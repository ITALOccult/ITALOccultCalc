<H1>Asteroid Observations - Fit shape models</H1>



<h2 class="auto-style9">1. Getting the shape models for analysis</h2>
<p>There are several ways in which shape models can be displayed with observed 
chords. Common to all ways is a requirement that the menu item on the Plot form
<strong>Plot options...Add DAMIT and ISAM shape images</strong> is checked. 
Additionally, the menu item <strong>Plot Options...
</strong><em><strong>Show shape model controls on Plot</strong></em> must be checked 
- as this displays the Shape Model control for managing the addition of shape 
model data to the event record.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the Observations editor includes a box in the Asteroid group 
displaying the number of DAMIT and ISAM shape models that are available. That 
box looks like:</p>
<img src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20GetModels.PNG">
<p>Simply click on any of the blue area. Occult will retrieve all the 
required/available shape models, and set the above two checks</p>
<h2 class="auto-style9">2. The Shape model control</h2>
<p>The Shape model control on the plot form facilitates the fitting of shape 
models and the retention of fits. The control looks like:</p>
<img src="Asteroid%20observations%20-%20fit%20shape%20models.PNG" width="400"><p>
or with the uncertainty chords set for shape model fitting<p>
<img src="Asteroid%20observations%20-%20fit%20shape%20modelsDia.PNG" width="200"><p>
or, for displaying phase-adjusted versions of a shape model<p>
<img src="Asteroid%20observations%20-%20fit%20shape%20models%20Phase.PNG" width="400"></p>
<p>The Shape model control can be moved anywhere around (but inside) the plot 
form - by simply dragging it with the mouse.</p>
<p><strong>The tools available on this control in normal mode are:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>A series of buttons labeled 1 to 6 for both <strong>DAMIT</strong> and<strong> 
	ISAM</strong> that allow the selection of particular shape models. Buttons 
	are green when a shape model has been fitted, and plum whena shape model has not been fitted.</li>
	<li>When a button is been selected, the button will be bright green if a 
	model has been previously fitted, or pink when a model hasn't previously 
	been fitted. The button number is also made bold.</li>
	<li>Many models in ISAM are the same as models in DAMIT. When this occurs, a 
	small white box with a red number will be next to an ISAM button, giving the number of the DAMIT button 
	that has the same model</li>
	<li>A button<strong> Light Curves</strong>, for downloading information 
	about the dates light curves were obtained to generate the shape model, and 
	the fit of the shape model to those light curves. <strong>This is only available for 
	DAMIT models</strong>. The button is greyed out and disabled when an ISAM model is 
	displayed</li>
	<li>A box <strong>Source</strong>, which contains the source of the model 
	being displayed (DAMIT or ISAM). It is set by the program (and forms part of the model fit 
	data that is retained).</li>
	<li>A box <strong>ID</strong>, which contains the model identification in 
	the source. DAMIT models have an identification that is independent of the 
	asteroid number. For ISAM, the asteroid number is implicitly part of the 
	identification, and otherwise falls in the range 1 to 6.</li>
	<li>A box labeled<strong> Surf/Vol.</strong> This gives the ratio of the Surface-equivalent 
	diameter to the Volume-equivalent diameter of the shape 
	model, and is fixed by code from the download. [The 
	Surface-equivalent diameter is always greater than the volume-equivalent diameter.]<br>
	<ul>By way of further explanation... A diameter is a quantity inherently 
		associated with a smooth sphere. However an asteroid is an irregular 
		object, which raises the question of - what is its diameter? There are 
		two approaches to this issue. A volume-equivalent diameter is the 
	diameter of a sphere having the same volume as the asteroid. A 
	Surface-equivalent diameter is the diameter of a sphere having the same 
	surface area as the asteroid.<em> Prima facie</em>, volume-equivalent 
	diameters are relevant to assessments of density, whereas surface-equivalent 
	diameters are relevant to assessments of brightness.</ul></li>
	<li>A drop-down box labeled <strong>Fit Quality</strong>, to be completed by the user. See 
	below. If the current displayed value needs to be selected, simply click on the drop-down box. 
	(There is no need to display the list and select from it.)</li>
	<li>A box labeled<strong> Ph Corrn</strong>. The value here is automatically completed if the 
	user adjusts the rotational phase of the asteroid - see below.</li>
	<li>A button for changing the basis the the uncertainty regions on the plot. 
	When Green with 'Err', the uncertainties represent the reported event time 
	uncertainties. When Yellow with 'Dia', the uncertainties are reduced to 
	match the uncertainty in the chord length. This button will get 
	automatically cleared whenever the main Editor form is selected (although 
	the plot won't change until the plot form is selected).</li>
	<li>Boxes labeled <strong>Minimum dia</strong> and <strong>Maximum dia</strong>, which are set by the user by 
	clicking the adjacent <strong>Set</strong> button - see below</li>
	<li>A text box labeled <strong>Version Info</strong> - which gives information about the 
	model that can be relevant to interpreting the results. The content is 
	automatically set from the download. See below for its significance.</li>
	<li>A slider bar for adjusting the size of the asteroid image on the plot. 
	<span class="auto-style8">If 
	this slider is to be used, it can be very helpful to check the menu item
	<strong>Keep form on top</strong> - as otherwise the display will oscillate 
	between the P<strong>lot Event observations </strong>form display and the
	<strong>DAMIT and ISAM Shape Models </strong>form display. [Having clicked 
	that menu item, you can return the form to its normal state by clicking the 
	menu item <strong>Return form to normal</strong></span>]</li>
	<li>A <strong>Save/update</strong> button to save the results of the fit of the shape model to the 
	occultation chords. The label of 
	the button changes to match the shape model being displayed.
	When a DAMIT model is selected, and there is a corresponding ISAM model, the 
	Save/update button with indicate both the DAMIT and ISAM models, and will 
	save/update both models.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>
	<span class="auto-style10"><ul>IMPORTANT</span></strong><span class="auto-style8">. This 
	button stores the results of the shape model fit in memory. It does <em>not</em> save 
	the results in an observations file for the event. The results are only 
	saved when the observation as a whole is saved or updated. See near the end of this 
	Help topic page for information about <strong>Saving/deleting the Shape model fits</strong></span></ul><br>
	</li>
</ul>
A model can also be displayed for a range of rotational orientations. This is achieved using the menu item <strong>with Phase models</strong> in the Shape Model display form. When this is selected, the control is changed in the following manner:
<ul>
	<li>The buttons for DAMIT and ISAM models are replaced by a series of 
	buttons labeled 0 to 9 - corresponding to increments in the rotational 
	orientation. 
	Button 4 corresponds to the 'zero' point of the phase adjusted models.</li>
	<li>Selecting a button allows the orientation of the shape model to be 
	adjusted, to give the best fit. The rotational phase adjustment is displayed 
	in the <strong>Ph Corrn</strong> box.</li>
	<li>The functioning of all other items on the control are unchanged.</li>
	<li>As a general rule, phase adjustments should not be required. See below 
	for more information.</li>
	<li>When the control is in the Phase model mode, the usual 'exit' button at 
	the top right of the control operates to close the Phase mode, and return 
	the control to its normal mode of functioning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="auto-style9">3. The fitting process</h2>
<p>The process involves considering each shape model in turn.</p>
<p><strong>For each shape model</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>two fits of the model to the observed chords are made. One fit is for 
	the minimum size of the shape model that can reasonably fit the observed 
	chords, while the other fit is for the largest size of the shape model that 
	can reasonably fit the observed chords.</li>
	<li>In making these fits, note that:<ul>
		<li>the uncertainty in the chord lengths needs to be displayed (menu 
		item <strong>Plot options... Show error bars</strong>)</li>
		<li>the location of the center of the shape model will frequently be 
		different in some degree between the two fits. That is, do not look for 
		minimum and maximum diameters on the basis of a fixed location of the 
		shape model relative to the chords - treat the fitting independently.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Make the fit by adjusting one or other (or both) the plot scale of the 
	shape model (using the slider on the <strong>Shape model contro</strong>l, 
	or the slider on the <strong>DAMIT and ISAM shape models</strong> form) or 
	the plot scale of the chords on the Plot form.</li>
	<li>When satisfied you have identified the minimum size shape model that 
	fits the chords, click the <strong>Set</strong> button next to the <strong>
	Minimum dia</strong> box. that will populate the box with the corresponding 
	volume-equivalent diameter of the asteroid.</li>
	<li>Repeat for the maximum size shape model, and click the <strong>Set</strong> 
	button next to the <strong>Maximum dia</strong> box.</li>
	<li>From the drop-down box for <strong>Fit quality</strong>, select the most appropriate 
	description of the quality of the fit of the shape model to the observed 
	chords. The settings are described below. If the value you want is already 
	displayed, but the text underneath the box is different, simply click 
	the box. (There is no need to display the list and select from it.)</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Save/update model...</strong> button to save the 
	values on the shape model control<strong><em> in memory</em></strong>. 
	<span class="auto-style8">[See 
	near the end of this Help topic page for information about <strong>Saving/deleting the Shape model fits</strong>.]</span></li>
	<li>Move to the next shape model, and repeat the process.</li>
	<li>You can go back to models you have already processed, and adjust the 
	values. The value of each quantity currently held in memory for the selected 
	shape model is displayed below the various boxes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Making the best fit</h3>
<p><em><strong>COMMENT</strong> - This section will need to be expanded with experience. Suggestions 
for advice to give here welcome!</em></p>
<p>When fitting shape models, it is important to have the observations 
uncertainty displayed - by checking the menu item on the <strong>Plot form Plot 
options... Show ERROR bars</strong></p>
<p>The Control provide the following list of <strong>Fit Quality</strong> 
settings</p>
<ul>
	<li>Not fitted</li>
	<li>Bad occultation data</li>
	<li>Model wrong</li>
	<li>Minimum diameter</li>
	<li>Diameter but no fit</li>
	<li>Poor fit</li>
	<li>Good fit</li>
	<li>Not constrained</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="auto-style8">Guidance for these options are:

</h3>

<h4>For events where the chords are a good fit to the shape model:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>This situation would require several chords on either side of the 
	asteroid that are well aligned to the shape model.</li>
	<li>For the minimum diameter, make a best-fit alignment of the shape model 
	with the 'innermost' ends of the error bars; and</li>
	<li>For the maximum diameter, make a best-fit alignment of the shape model 
	with the 'outermost' ends of the error bars;</li>
</ul>
<h4>For events where the chords are a poor fit to the profile</h4>
<ul>
	<li>This situation would require several chords on either side of the 
	asteroid, but those chords do not align well with the shape model.</li>
	<li>The first step is to ascertain where a rotational phase shift adjustment 
	might result in a better fit (see the next section). Otherwise, the 
	discrepancies between the occultation chords and the shape model may be a 
	combination of 'errors' in both the occultation observations and the shape 
	models. For these reasons it is appropriate to fit the chords to the shape 
	model:</li>
	<li>For the minimum diameter, make a best-fit alignment of the smallest 
	shape model that fits a relatively large number of the observed chords; and</li>
	<li>For the maximum diameter, make a best-fit alignment of the largest shape 
	model that fits a relatively large number of the observed chords</li>
</ul>
<h4>Diameter but no fit</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
	There may be times when the occultation chords can be fitted to a shape 
	model, but cannot be used to draw any meaningful conclusions about the shape 
	model. Typical situations include having two chords on the same side but 
	reasonably well spaced. In this situation it is unlikely that any meaningful 
	conclusions about the shape model can be drawn. However it is quite likely 
	that the diameter of the asteroid can be determined - particularly if the 
	two (or however many ) chords align with the shape model.</li>
	<li>
	The situation of having two chords on opposite sides of the asteroid 
	would normally be covered by Good or Poor fit.</li>
	<li>For the minimum diameter, make a best-fit alignment of the smallest 
	shape model that fits a relatively large number of the observed chords; and</li>
	<li>For the maximum diameter, make a best-fit alignment of the largest shape 
	model that fits a relatively large number of the observed chords</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minimum diameter</h4>
<ul>
	<li>This most commonly arises when there is a single chord, or several closely spaced chords</li>
	<li>Fit the observed chord along the longest transverse of the 
	shape model, with the edge of the shape model aligned with a point about 2/3 
	of the distance from the event location, towards the 'innermost' end of the 
	error bars.</li>
</ul>
<h4>For events where the shape model is wrong</h4>
<ul>
	<li>normally this would only be set if there is another shape model that 
	clearly fits the event chords. When this quality is set, the maximum 
	and minimum diameters cannot be set.</li>
	<li>This setting is not about whether one model is preferable to another. 
	Rather it is an indication that the shape of the shape model is totally 
	inconsistent with its actual shape </li>
	<li>If all the available shape models clearly do not match the 
	observed chords in any meaningful way, it is appropriate to select <strong>
	Model wrong</strong> for all shape models.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bad occultation data</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>This is used when there are problems with the occultation data which 
	cannot be reliably resolved (such as by excluding obviously discordant 
	chords, or applying time shifts to correct obvious time base errors)</li>
	<li>This issue is more common before ~2000, when the majority of 
	observations were visual. Time base errors can also be associated with NTP 
	(Network Time Protocol)</li>
	<li>When it is apparent that the occultation data has unresolved problems, 
	maximum and minimum diameters cannot be set. Essentially the occultation 
	observation is excluded form any further analysis that might be undertaken.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Not constrained</h4>
<ul>
	<li>this is used when ever the chords are insufficient to place any 
	reasonable constraints on the size of the asteroid. Typical situations are:<ul>
		<li>a single chord which is shorter than about 60% of the asteroid's 
		nominal diameter. However care needs to be exercised when the shape 
		model is highly elongate, as a short chord fitted to a short 
		cross-section may give a realistic diameter.</li>
		<li>several chords located on one side of the asteroid, with it being 
		possible to fit the chords using greatly different diameters for the 
		asteroid. normally this would only be set if there is another shape model that 
	clearly fits the event chords. When this quality is set, the maximum 
	and minimum diameters cannot be set.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Not fitted</h4>
<ul>
	<li>For events from about 2021, this setting is only present when no fit has 
	been made to a shape model. Prior to 2021, this setting was also applied 
	when the fit was <strong>Not constrained</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Rotating the Shape model</h3>
<p>In certain circumstances it may be appropriate to consider whether the shape 
model would fit better if the rotational phase was adjusted. Changing the 
rotational phase is only justifiable if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the time between the event and the observations used to create the shape 
	model is large - typically &gt;10 years;</li>
	<li>the light curve variations are generally small; and/or</li>
	<li>the shape model is heavily dependent on 'scattered' brightness measures 
	rather than a continuous light curve measurement. That is, observations from 
	Lowell, USNO, Catalina or Gaia</li>
</ul>
<p>It is generally useful to 
have the axis of rotation of the asteroid displayed. This can be done by checking the menu item on the <strong>
DAMIT and ISAM shape models </strong>form&nbsp; <strong>...with Model image... Include rotational 
axis</strong></p>
<p>You can assess whether it is appropriate to vary the rotational phase for any shape model 
in <strong>DAMIT</strong> by clicking <strong>Light curves </strong>on 
the <strong>Shape model control</strong> on the Plot form, or the menu items
<strong>with Model image...&nbsp; List DAMIT parameters and light curves</strong>, 
and <strong>with Model image...&nbsp; Display model fit to light curves (DAMIT).
</strong>These will provide details of the light curve data, and show the fit of 
the shape model to the observed light curve.</p>
<p>The display of phase-adjusted shape models must be done from the <strong>
DAMIT and ISAM shape models</strong> form. Select the shape model for which you 
want a series of phase-adjusted shape models (either DAMIT or ISAM). Then from 
the menu item&nbsp; <strong>with Phase models...</strong> click the relevant 
step intervals. This will display 10 phase models at the specified 
step interval. </p>
<p><br><strong>Hint 2</strong>. You can change the zero-point of 
the phase-offset series using the <strong>Zero phase</strong> up-down control on 
the <strong>
DAMIT and ISAM shape models</strong> form. 
This can be particularly useful if you start with a coarse set of phase 
models, and want to have a closer look at a series of models near a particular 
offset.</p>
<p>Where there are multiple occultation events for the asteroid, one would 
expect any phase adjustment to be associated with a change in the rotational 
period. That is, the adjustment should vary linearly with time. The <strong>
Adjust rotation</strong> control on the <strong>DAMIT and ISAM shape models</strong> form allows the user to apply changes to the rotational period 
to assess whether there is a basis to adjust the rotational phase.</p>
<p>To return to the selection of shape models - on the <strong>DAMIT and ISAM 
shape models</strong> form, either <br>* click the usual <strong>Exit</strong> 
button at the top right of the Shape model control; or<br>* click the menu item with <strong>Phase 
models... Close phase model display control</strong></p>
<h3>The DAMIT Quality values</h3>
<p>
<table class="standard description">
	<tr class="even">
		<td class="label">&nbsp;</td>
		<td class="description">The DAMIT system incorporates a Quality Factor<strong> 
		QF</strong> that provides some information about the reliability of the 
		derived shape model The value ranges&nbsp; between 0 and 5. However 
		for many of the older models a value is not yet assigned. The scale, as 
		set out on the DAMIT site, is 
		as follows:<br><strong>5</strong> – &quot;ground-truth&quot; models reconstructed 
		from images obtained by spacecraft (usually not included in DAMIT but 
		available through PDS);<br><strong>4</strong> – models based on a large 
		photometric data set and disk-resolved data and/or stellar occultations, 
		the pole ambiguity is resolved, they should well correspond to the real 
		shape of the asteroid;<br><strong>3</strong> – reliable models based on 
		large photometric data sets;<br><strong>2</strong> – models 
		reconstructed from only few dense light curves combined with sparse 
		data, the shape is not very certain;<br><strong>1</strong> – coarse 
		shape models based solely on sparse data, large errors both in the shape 
		and pole direction;<br><strong>0</strong> – just one possible model out 
		of many. <br><strong>n/a</strong> - no uncertainty value is available 
		for this model.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>Regard should be had to the values (when available) when trying to identify 
the shape model that best fits the observed chords. Note that 'sparse data' is a 
reference to single point photometry from several observatories made over many 
years, in contrast to the continuous monitoring of an asteroid for many hours to 
obtain a light curve on a single night - this being repeated with the asteroid 
being at differing locations in its orbit</p>
<h3>The ISAM version information</h3>
<p>The version field can contain the following acronyms:</p>
<p>KOALA : Knitted Occultation, Adaptive-optics and Light-curve Analysis.<br>

	Analysis</div>
<h3><strong>Dealing with poor occultation observations</strong></h3>
<p>It is inevitable that from time-to-time users will have to deal with an event 
where the observed chords do not match any of the available shape models. Issues 
to be considered are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The validity of the shape model(s).&nbsp; </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>For a DAMIT model with a quality factor of 4 or 5, the model should 
		be highly reliable. As a result, any mismatches between the occultation 
		chords and the shape model is reason to have a very close look at the 
		occultation observations - on the basis that the cause of mismatch will 
		most likely (but not always) be with the occultation observations.</li>
		<li>For DAMIT models with Quality factors of 3, any significant mismatch 
		could be caused by either inadequacies in the shape model, or erroneous 
		occultation data</li>
		<li>For DAMIT models with a quality factor 0, 1 or 2 - the starting 
		point is that the occultation data is likely to be more reliable than 
		the shape model.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Erroneous occultation observations<br></strong>Erroneous 
	occultation results are an infrequent but regular occurrence. Sources of 
	error include<ul>
		<li>&nbsp;<strong>poor time base</strong>. The most reliable time base 
		(as at 2018) is a video-inserted GPS-sourced time stamp on each video 
		frame. Other time sources can have a range of issues with uncertainties of 
		differing magnitude. When the position (but not length) of an observed 
		chord is inconsistent 
		with other observed chords, it will usually be appropriate to make 
		enquiries about the time 
		base that was used.</li>
		<li><strong>visual observations</strong>. Before 2000, the majority of 
		observations were made visually, whereas by 2010 the majority are made 
		using video or the like. Visual observations have issues of  
		reliability arising from observer tiredness and the need to concentrate for 
		long periods of time, as well as the need to apply Personal Equation 
		(PE) - with PE usually severely underestimated for the D, and somewhat 
		underestimated for the R. Asserted PE's of 0.5 sec or less should be 
		treated skeptically.</li>
		<li><strong>event only marginally visible</strong>. The reliability of 
		an observation can be adversely affected if the star is barely visible, 
		or there are significant atmospheric disturbances or cloud, or if the 
		magnitude drop is very small.</li>
		<li><strong>Observer monitors the wrong star</strong> This is relevant 
		for Miss chords which are inconsistent with adjacent chords that 
		record an occultation event.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="auto-style9">4. Saving/deleting the Shape model fits</h2>
<p>Shape model fits are saved/retained in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you are working with an individual file for an event, by saving that 
	event after having made the fits(s)</li>
	<li>If you are working with the <strong>Historical Observations</strong> file, by updating 
	the event in that file</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view the details of the shape model solutions from the <strong>
Observations Edito</strong>r, using the menu item <strong>Shape models... List current-event shape model solutions</strong>.&nbsp; If you have 
inadvertently created extra shape model solutions over that which is 
appropriate, you can delete these using the <strong>Observations editor</strong> 
menu item <strong>Shape models... Delete current-event shape model solution(s)</strong>. 
Simply check the entries to be deleted, and click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p>Occasionally a shape model will be deleted from DAMIT or ISAM, and solutions 
for those models should be removed - using the delete function. The presence of 
such models will be indicated on Observations Editor form, where shape model 
fitting information is displayed. </p>
