<!-- Insert Header in above line -->

<p>This form is for predicting eclipses, occultations and transits involving satellites of the major planets.<p>
<p>For predictions of coordinates of satellites, or graphics of the satellites about the planet, see the <B>Ephemerides </B>tab.
<h2><br>Eclipses, occultations and transits - <I>with the Planet</I></h2>
<p>As moons orbit around a planet, they undergo eclipses, occultations and transits with the body of the planet. For Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, these events only occur when the equatorial plane of the planet is near to edge-on. This option is for computing these events.</p>
<p>The moons included in the predictions, and the frequency of events, are as follows:<ul>
<li><B>Jupiter. </B>Predictions are generated for Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Events involving Io, Europa and Ganymede occur continuously, whereas events involving Callisto do not occur for a period of around 3 years every 6 years.<br><br></li>
<li><B>Saturn. </B>Predictions are generated for satellites 1 to 6, and 8  (Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Iapetus). Events occur for a period of about 4 years every 14 years - with the first period in the 21st century starting in late 2007. However events involving Iapetus occur about 12 months before the other satellites (because of the large inclination of the orbit.)<br><br></li>
<li><B>Uranus.  </B>Predictions are generated for the 5 main satellites (Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, and Miranda.) Events occur for a period of about 6 years every 42 years, with the latest series starting in 2004.<br><br></li>
<li><B>Neptune. </B>Predictions are generated for Triton. Events occur for a period of about 7 years every 82 years.  The next sequence starts in 2043.</li></ul></p>
<p>The predictions give the mid-time of the events. However the events are not instantaneous. For Jupiter's satellites the duration is typically several minutes. For Iapetus, the duration can be around 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Predictions can be generated for any period of time. Importantly, the output can be limited to only those events that are visible from your location - that is, at the event time the planet's altitude > 0 deg, and Sun's altitude < -6 deg (civil twilight).</p>

<h2><br>Mutual eclipses and occultations</h2>
<p>As moons orbit around a planet, they can undergo mutual eclipses and occultations. With the exception of Iapetus (Saturn), these events occur near the time the Earth passes through the equatorial plane of the planet. This option is for computing these events.</p>
<p>The moons included in the predictions, and the frequency of events, are as follows:<ul>
<li><B>Jupiter. </B>Predictions are generated for Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Events occur for a period of around 16 months every 6 years. 
The next series starts in 2009.<br><br></li>
<li><B>Saturn. </B>Predictions are generated for satellites 1 to 6, and 8  (Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Iapetus). Events occur for a period of about 2&frac12 years every 14 years - with the first period in the 21st century starting in late 2008. Events involving Iapetus occur about 12 months before the other satellites (because of the large inclination of the orbit.) - but are exceedingly rare.<br><br></li>
<li><B>Uranus.  </B>Predictions are generated for the 5 main satellites (Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, and Miranda.) Events occur for a period of about 18 months every 42 years, with the latest series starting in late 2006.</li></ul></p>
<p>Predictions include basic event details (time, duration, magnitude drop), and the contact times for each of the phases of the event. Also generated is a graphic showing the relationship between the two moons (for occultations), or the moon and the shadow (both umbra and penumbra) for eclipses.
<p>Predictions can be generated for any period of time. Importantly, the output can be limited to only those events that are visible from your location - that is, at the event time the planet's altitude > 0 deg, and Sun's altitude < -6 deg (civil twilight).</p>
