<h2>Adding Orbital Elements from Horizons</h2>
<P>The JPL Horizons system can generate accurate orbital elements at any epoch. 
This has particular advantages when the orbital integration routine in Occult is 
inadequate. This particularly occurs with orbits that have a large eccentricity 
(eg greater than 0.4), or a small perihelion distance(eg less than 1.5AU). 
Accuracy can also be lost if the event date is many years from the current date.<P>
In these circumstances, Occult can 'automatically' download the elements for an 
object for a user-specified date. 
This can occur in three locations: on the <strong>Asteroid Search</strong> form, 
on the <strong>List and Display </strong>form, and on the form 
for editing the file of UserAsteroids. 
<h2 class="auto-style3">
Adding elements for a single asteroid when searching</h2>
<P>
The process for using Horizons for a single asteroid when conducting a search on the <strong>Asteroid Search Form
</strong>is set out <a href="Asteroid%20predictions%20-%20Search.htm">here.</a>
<P>
The process is limited to searches with a duration of less than 35 days, and 
limited to a single asteroid. The intent is to provide an accurate prediction 
for an object of special interest - and in particular, when that object is in an 
orbit with eccentricity greater than 0.4 and semimajor axis less than 2AU.<h2 class="auto-style3">
Creating a User file of asteroid elements to match events of interest</h2>
The work-flow for 
	this option is<ul>
		<li>generate a set of predictions using <strong>MPCORB</strong>, <strong>
		Astorb</strong>, or <strong>AstDys-2</strong>. Typically they would be 
		for a time-limited period of a month or two, appropriate for generating 
		an OccultWatcher feed or personal predictions</li>
		<li>use the filter options on the List and display form to limit the 
		listed events to those that are of potential interest</li>
		<li>select this option, to create a User file of asteroid elements, by 
		downloading orbital elements form JPL-Horizons</li>
		<li>Re-do the search for the time period, but this time check the box on 
		the Search form <strong>use USER file of elements</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>the resulting search will be based on Horizon elements. More information 
	is <a href="Asteroid%20predictions%20-%20ListAndDisplay.htm">here</a></p>
<h2><span class="auto-style3">Adding elements using the Editor for the UserAsteroids file
</span> <br>
</h2>
<P>
The basic function of the UserAsteroids editor is the manual addition of 
asteroid and comet orbits.&nbsp;
<P>
The functionality to add orbits from Horizons is enabled by clicking the Menu 
item Add elements from JPL-Horizons. This will disable the general editor 
functions, and will display a panel that looks like<P><img src="UserAsteroid_Horizons.PNG" width="600"><P class="auto-style1">
This panel can be moved around the form by dragging it with the cursor.<P class="auto-style1">
The top row of data elements is used to set the epoch for the elements to be 
downloaded. The panel opens with the current UTC date being displayed. The date 
can be set to any date (within reason....). All downloaded elements will be for 
this epoch.<P class="auto-style1">
A button is provided to delete all elements in the list.<h2 class="auto-style3">
Adding Asteroids</h2>
<P class="auto-style1">The left part of the form is for specifying 
the asteroids to be downloaded. There are two basic options.<ul>
	<li>
	Specify a set of asteroids either individually, or as 
	a range; or
	</li>
	<li>
	Specify all asteroids greater than a certain diameter</li>
</ul>
These options are selected by clicking the appropriate radio button. For the 
radio buttons relating to asteroid size, the number of asteroids that will be 
downloaded is indicated by the number below the radio button. If a Diameter 
radio button is selected, the text box below the buttons for specifying 
individual asteroids is disabled.<br><br>If the <strong>by Number</strong> 
option is selected, the text box below the buttons for specifying individual 
asteroids is enabled. You then specify the asteroids to be downloaded. The 
following are examples of valid inputs<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 254&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="auto-style2">{for asteroid 254 alone}</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
-100&nbsp; <span class="auto-style2">{for asteroids 1 to 100 inclusive}</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
456-543&nbsp; <span class="auto-style2">{for asteroids 456 to 543 inclusive}</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
4, 76, 3696, 25, 50000&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style2">{for asteroids 4, 
25, 76, 3696 and 50000. The order is not important}<br><br></span>Spaces can be 
included between numbers. But any other characters will result in an error 
message.<br><br>Be careful about how many asteroids you specify. Assuming a 
reasonable internet speed it will take about 1 second to download for each 
asteroid. [The program imposes a limit of 5000 asteroids.]<br><br>To start 
downloading, simply click <strong>Retrieve elements</strong>. If there are any 
issues with the specified criteria you will get an error message, and you will 
need to correct the relevant entry.<br><br>If the criteria are valid, the 
process for retrieving the elements will begin. At the bottom left of the form 
the number of the just-downloaded asteroid will be displayed on an 
asteroid-by-asteroid basis. After every 10 asteroids, the displayed list of 
asteroids held in the editor will be updated (with the display being focused on 
the last asteroid in the list).<br><br>Also displayed is an <strong>Abort</strong> 
button to cancel the downloads. It may require clicking more than once to be 
effective (and it will only abort after the end of the current asteroid 
download).<br><br>When the download is completed, all the displayed asteroids 
are saved in an updated UserAsteroids file.<br><br>You can view the asteroids in 
the list while the Horizons panel is displayed, using the scroll bar. However 
you cannot edit any entry.<br><br>You leave the Horizons panel by clicking the
<strong>X</strong> at the top right of the panel.<br><br><h2 class="auto-style3">Adding Comets</h2>
<p>

The form provides a list of all comets held in the MPC Comets file, which is 
download #2. For newly discovered comets, you need to download the latest 
version of that file.<p>

There are three categories of comets listed. The identifications are in the 
form:<p>

<table class="auto-style4" width="500">
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 210x">Identifier</td>
		<td style="width: 531px">Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 210px">C/yyyy id (Name)</td>
		<td style="width: 531px">C = near-parabolic orbit, single apparition</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 210px">P/yyyy id (Name)</td>
		<td style="width: 531px">P = periodic comet, single apparition</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 210px">xxxP/Name</td>
		<td style="width: 531px">Periodic comet observed at multiple appearances</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 210px">xI/Name</td>
		<td style="width: 531px">Interstellar comet</td>
	</tr>
</table>
&nbsp;<p>

The id is structured as the half-month of discovery, and the sequence of the 
discovery in that month. That A2 is the 2nd comet discovered in Jan 1-15, B5 is 
the 5th comet discovered in the period Jan16-31.<p>

<span class="auto-style5"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></span>. The positions of 
comets are far less reliable than for asteroids. This is a combination of the 
nucleus not being readily identifiable within the coma, and the presence of 
non-gravitational forces. Within the first month of discovery the ephemeris is 
usually quite inaccurate - far too inaccurate for sensible occultation 
predictions. In general, periodic comets at multiple returns have the best 
orbits - and hence will provide more reliable predictions than for other comets.<p>

<span class="auto-style5"><strong>IMPORTANT #2.</strong></span> Becaiuse of 
non-gravitational forces, as well as orbits being not as well defined as for 
asteroids, ensure the Horizons elements are downloaded for about the mid-point 
of the time period you are covering for your search, and keep the search 
duration relatively short (a month or two)<p>

<span class="auto-style5"><strong>IMPORTANT #3</strong></span>. Comets of the 
for C/ have near parabolic orbits. The integration scheme in Occult may be 
suboptimal. As a genera rule, keep predictions for such comets to a relatively 
short period, such as a month or two.<p>

To add comet elements to the User file, check the comets you want to add (double 
click). You can clear all the checks using the <strong>Clear all checks</strong> 
button. Or you can clear checks individually. The number of comets that have 
been selected is given in the yellow download button.<p>

When you have made your selection, click the Retrieve xx elements. This will 
query Horizons, and add the elements to the main list. The file will be 
automatically saved at the end of the download.<p>

<strong><em>When you have added comets to the UsersAsteroids file, do not check 
the Horizons button on the search form. If checked, the program will attempt to 
download elements again, and may fail.</em></strong><p>
