<H1>Asteroid observations - prediction offsets</H1>

If a predicted point on the centre line is included in the observation report, this option will list the offset of the observed occultation from the prediction - in along-path time (in secs), and cross-path distance (in km)

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
O-C's for predictions: 

 22 Predicted Path, Steve Preston          dT =   0.9 secs,  dist = -63 km
</pre>

<p>The reference number at the start of the line is the observation number in the list of observations. There can be more than one 'prediction' included in the observations.

<p>In this instance, the event occurred 0.9s later than predicted, with the path being 
displaced 63 km south of the predicted path.
