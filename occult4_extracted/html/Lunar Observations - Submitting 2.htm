<H1>Submitting your observations</H1>
<I><B>Note </B>- the ability to email observations from Occult assumes you have an email account with your ISP, using an 'SMTP' server. If you use a browser-based email service (such as Hotmail or GoogleMail), you will have to manually create the email and attach the observation file.</I>

<p>This form is used to select the email address to send the report, and to send the report.

<p>The box at the left lists the addresses for reporting observations. As you select an address, the corresponding email address is displayed. If you have previously reported results, the address you last used will be highlighted/selected when you open the form. However if the report contains any graze observations, the address for grazes will be highlighted. [All reports containing graze observations should be reported to the 'Graze' address].
<p>Once you have selected the reporting address, click 'OK'. A message will indicate whether the email has been successfully sent. A copy of the email will be sent to your email inbox as a BCC message - so that you have a record of the report you have sent.

<p>Several days (or perhaps weeks) after submitting your observations, you should receive an email from the reporting address that provides a preliminary reduction of your observations. If there are any problems with the observations, that email may ask for further information. You should respond to any queries as soon as possible.

<h2>Reporting frequency</h2>
You should report your observations at least on a monthly basis.
<P><B>NOTE </B>- the desirable reporting frequency will depend upon the experience gained by IOTA with collecting observations. Where an observer makes many observations on one night, it may be appropriate to report the observations at the end of that night..

<h2>Managing your observations</h2>
<B>It is important that you carefully manage your observations. If you send copies of your observations to different addresses, the result will be duplicate observations when the observations received by the various reporting addresses are combined to create the file for archiving. <U>The person who has to identify and remove those duplicates will not be happy! </U>Similarly you should ensure that once you have sent a report, you do not add more observations to that report. You should always create a new report for any observations made after sending a report. </B>If you are not sure about what observations have been sent - refer to the copies of the report that you receive as part of the process of submitting the report (which you should keep for this purpose.)

<h2>Obtaining current reporting addresses</h2>
<p>Occult uses a list of reporting addresses that is maintaind on various servers around the world. This enables you to obtain 'current' email addresses without having to manually update addresses whenever one might change. You should update the addresses every few months or so.
<p>To update the address list:<ul>
<li>From the menu of Lunar Occultation Observations Editor, click <B>Submit report..  Download Current email reporting Addresses</B>.
<li>The form that appears will list a number of sources. The first in the list allows an HTTP or FTP address to be manually entered. [This should not normally be required]. The remaining items in the list identify sources for downloading the file of addresses. The corresponding address is displayed when a source is selected.
<li>Select a source, and click Download. If there is a problem retrieving the file, you will get an error message. Otherwise you will get a message advising that the file has been updated.</ul>
<p>If you are unable to download the addresses from a selected site, try a different site. [This arrangement will allow you to obtain a current list of addresses even if a site becomes inactive.]


<h2>Set-up requirements</h2>
<p>To be able to submit your observations, Occult needs to know the address of your mail server, and your email address. A copy of your report is copied to your email address - so that you will always have a full copy of the report that was sent.

<p>These addresses can be set from the  Maintenance tab, User settings - Internet   FTP  box. If you have not set them here, you will be presented with a form requiring you to enter these settings when you try to submit your observations.

<p>The address of your email server will have been provided to you by your ISP. If you are not sure what it is, you can obtain it from your email application. For users of OutlookExpress, it can be found under 'Tools, Accounts, Mail - Properties button'. For Microsoft Mail it is found under 'Tools, Accounts - Properies button, Servers'.
