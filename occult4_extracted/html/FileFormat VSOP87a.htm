<!-- Insert Header in above line -->
<P>Occult includes the VSOP87A series as a default basis for computing planetary ephemerides - of Sun, and Mercury to Neptune. VSOP87 is a fit to the JPL-DE200 ephemeris.</p>
<p>The files Mercury.bin to Neptune.bin contain coefficients for computing the ecliptic X,Y,Z co-ordinates of the planets according to the <B>VSOP </B>expressions. The series has been truncated to terms with coefficients >5e-8 AU in any of the X,Y,Z co-ordinates - except for the Earth/Sun. The record length in each file is 26, with the following structure:

<P>The co-ordinates are computed for a given Julian date JD as follows:</p>

<p> t=(jd-2451545)/365250<br>

 term= A * sin(B + C*t) * t<sup>P</sup></p>

<p>The co-ordinates are computed by summing the terms for each co-ordinate. The equatorial XYZ co-ordinates are obtained through a rotation to the equator, and a small equinox correction. The conversion made is:</p>
<pre>
X<sub>e</sub> = X + 0.00000044036 * Y - 0.000000190919 * Z
Y<sub>e</sub> = -0.000000479966 * X + 0.917482137087 * Y - 0.397776982902 * Z
Z<sub>e</sub> = 0.397776982902 * Y + 0.917482137087 * Z</pre>

<h2>PLUTO</h2>
The file <B>Pluto.bin </B>contains a series by Chapront that represents the position of Pluto over the period 1700 - 2100 to 0.03” (compared to DE200). The file is a binary file, with data stored as follows:

<p><li>106 binary records with the following field definitions:<ul>
FQ As Double, cX As Double, sX As Double, cY As Double, sY As Double, cZ As Double, sZ As Double</ul></p>

<p><li>3 binary records with field definitions:<ul>
a0 As Double, a1 As Double, a2 As Double, a3 As Double</ul></p>

<p>The co-ordinates for a given date are computed with:<ul>
Tp = 2 * (jd - 2341972.5) / 146120# - 1         (Tp ranges from -1 to +1)<br>
Fx = Tp * 73060<br>
Arg = FQ*Fx</p></ul>

<p>To obtain the X coord, sum the following values:

<li>cX*cos(Arg) + sX*sin(Arg)  [for records 1 to 82]</li>
<li>Tp*(cX*cos(Arg) + sX*sin(Arg))  [for records 83 to 101]</li>
<li>Tp*Tp*(cX*cos(Arg) + sX*sin(Arg))  [for records 102 to 106]</li>
<li>a0 + a1 * Tp + a2 * Tp * Tp + a3 * Tp * Tp * Tp [using the first record for a)</li></p>

<p>Y is obtained using cY, sY, and the second record for 'a';  Z using cZ and sZ and the third record for 'a'</p>

<p>The following is from the text file accompanying the series:<ul>
<li>The tables of Pluto have been constructed by J. Chapront (BDL) with a new method of approximation using frequency analysis as described in the paper :<br>
<I>Representation of planetary ephemerides by frequency analysis. Application to the five outer planets. </I><B>Astron. & Astrophys.Suppl. Ser</B>., 109, 191 (1995).</li><br><br>


<li>This representation uses the result of numerical integration DE200 of Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a source :<br>
Standish E. M., 1990, <I>The observational basis for JPL'DE200, the planetary ephemerides of the Astronomical Almanac</I>. <B>Astron. Astrophys.</B>, 233, 252.</li><br><br>

<li>The interval of validity is 146120 days.<br>
Start : Jan 01 1700 0h  JD2341972.5<br>
End :   Jan 24 2100 0h  JD2488092.5</li><br><br>

<li>The reference frame is defined with dynamical equinox and equator J2000 (DE200).</li><br><br>

<li>The numerical accuracy can be evaluated with the largest discrepancy obtained in a comparison with the ephemerides DE200 on the period 1700-2100 : for the positions  : 5 E-7 au (0.003")</li>
</ul></p>
