Light curves can be reported for either a lunar occultation, or an asteroidal occultation. The data that is collected and reported is different, resulting in two different ways to generate a light curve report.&nbsp;<h1>Lunar occultations</h1>
Lunar occultation light curve reports are generated from the Lunar Observations editor. This is most conveniently done when an observation is added in the editor. However an existing file of observations can be loaded, and a light curve report generated for any particular event - simply by selecting that event in the editor. The critical factor in both approaches is that the particular event must have been entered into the Obsrvations Editor, and be selected.
<p>To generate the Light Curve Report for a selected event:<ul>
<li>Click the menu item  <B>Light curve report...   Create Light curve report</B><br>
This will open the light curve report form, and populate all the biblographic data fields using the data in the Observations editor.
<li>Paste the measurements obtained from Limovie or Tangra, using<B> File... Paste CSV data set</B>. Alternatively, if you have previously saved the Limovie or Tangra measurments as a CSV file, you can use <B>File... Open CSV file</B> to read the measurements.
The processing of the measurements is the same as in AOTA. That is, there are screens to conduct a data integrity check, set the time scale, normalisation, and set the integration level (if any). After those screens the full light curve is displayed.
</ul>
To complete the report, see <B>Selecting and saving the light curve report </B>below. <p>
<B>NOTE: One of the data elements generated is the slope of the lunar limb. This calculation uses the LOLA database of the lunar profile.  While use of LOLA is not essential, all users are urged to use it - which means esnuring they have downloaded the file form the Downloads page of Occult (item 26 in the download list). If the LOLA database is present, the text<I> LRO-LOLA </I>will be present at the top-right of the Observation Editor.
</B>

<h1>Asteroidal occultations</h1>
Asteroidal Occultation reports are generated from the <B>Report a light curve </B>button on the Asteroidal observations page of the main form of Occult. This opens the Light curve report form. However, unlike a lunar observation, no bibligraphic data relating to the event are incorporated.

<p>To complete the Light curve report:<ul type=1>
<li>Paste the measurements obtained from Limovie or Tangra, using<B> File... Paste CSV data set</B>. Alternatively, if you have previously saved the Limovie or Tangra measurments as a CSV file, you can use <B>File... Open CSV file</B> to read the measurements.
The processing of the measurements is the same as in AOTA. That is, there are screens to conduct a data integrity check, set the time scale, normalisation, and set the integration level (if any). After those screens the full light curve is displayed.<br>
<font color=brown><B>IMPORTANT</B>. If you select or use the<B> File... Open </B>menu item, <I>all event and observer details are reset.</i> However this is not the case if the light curve data is Pasted</font>

<li>Click the green button <B>Set event && observer details.</B> This will open a new form where you specify the details of the event. 
<p></p><img src="LightCurveAddDetails.png" width="400">

<p>Particular issues are</p>
<ul>
<strong>Site and Observer</strong>
<ul>
<li>Specify the site coordinates in the usual manner</li>
	<li>Observer names are to be set out as Initial&nbsp; plus Family name. If 
	there are multiple observers, separate them with a slash&nbsp; '/'.</li>
<li>The site details for a frequently used site can be saved as default values using <B>Set as defaults</B>, and retrieved using <B>Use defaults</B>.
The Default sit will display whenever the light curve reporter is opened.<li>You 
	can additionally maintain a list of sites that you regularly use. For 
	example, if you observe from several specific sites. Or if you are reporting 
	on behalf of other observers. These sites are identified using a unique&nbsp; 
	identifier of your choice. Options are:<ul>
		<li>Select a site from the drop-down list - and those site details will 
		be listed<li>Add a site to the observer list - by specifying a new site 
		identifier. If the identifier is already in the list, you will be asked 
		if you want to replace the existing entry. If not, you will need to 
		specify a different identifier.<li>To delete a site, select that site 
		from the observer list, then click Delete.</ul>
	<li>The file containing the list of observers is in the Occult folder Sites, 
	with the file name <strong>LightCurveSites.dat</strong> The file includes a header line that identifies the fields. The 
	fields are separated by a pipe '|'. The file can be manually edited</li></ul>
	<strong>Date of the event</strong>
	<ul><li>Make sure you specify the UT date of the event, not the local date. If the observation was near 0Hrs UT, specify the date used in the prediction.</li></ul>
	<strong>Asteroid</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Specify the asteroid number. The name will be automatically retrieved. At this time un-numbered 
	asteroids cannot be entered</li>
	</ul>
	<strong>Star number</strong>
	<ul><li>Select the star catalogue and specify the catalogue number. </li></ul>
	
<font color=red>If you subsequently select or use the<B> File... Open </B>menu item, all event and observer details will be reset.</font></ul>
&nbsp&nbsp<li>When you have completed the form, click <B>Transfer data and exit</B>. This will populate the Light curve report form with the data entered. If you need to change any of the data entered via this form, simply re-open the form and edit the data as needed.

<h1>Selecting and saving the light curve report</h1>
<h2>Optimising the light curve</h2>
<h3>Background subtraction</h3>
Background is traditionally subtracted on a point-by-point basis. However his has the effect of adding background noise to the star signal. An alternative approach is to subtract the average value of the background for all points. This can often (but not always) result in a 'cleaner' light curve.
<h3>Normalisation</h3>
Particularly in the case of an asteroidal occultation, the light curve 
measurements may include one or more comparison stars. The light curves for any comparison star can be plotted by checking a relevant box at the bottom left of the report form.
<p>In circumstances where the sky transparency is variable over the course of the recording (eg light cloud), it may be appropriate to normalise the light curve of interest using a comparison star. Ideally the comparison star to use is one that is close to the target star (so that it is reasonable to expect light variations in the comparison star will also occur with the target star at the same time), and is bright (but not saturated) so that it has a good signal-to-noise characteristics. In reality the user will need to make a judgement call about which comparison star is best to use having regard to what would be ideal. To normalise the light curve of the target star, <ul>
<li> click the button <B>*Background *Integration *Binning *Normalisation</B>
<li>Check the Comparison star to use
<li>Select the Running Average value to use with the comparison star. Avoid using a short running average value, as this would simply add the noise from the comparison star to the target star. On the other hand, a large running average value will not be sensitive to 
relatively short variations in transparency.
<li>Click <B>OK</B> Review the plotted light curve. When necessary, change the comparison star and/or the running average value to improve the overall linearity of the target star light curve.
</ul>
<h3>Integration/binning</h3>
When the video camera has been used in integrating mode, it is <B><I>ESSENTIAL </I></B>that the light curve data is binned to match the integration periods. Click the button <B>*Integration *Binning *Normalisation</B> to set the binning to match the integration intervals.
<p>Some video capture devices can occassionally skip a frame. If this occurs with an integrated video, the binning will not match the integration after the skip has occurred. To check whether this is a possibility, click the <B>Integrity check</B>button. On the form displayed, set the<B> # frames integrated</B>. Set <B>Starting at # </B> such that the vertical lines on the plot match the start of each integration interval in the data displayed. Then scan down the plot to make sure that the lines continue to be aligned throughout. If not, determine where the skipped frame occurs (or, more rarely, a duplicated frame), and then use the left half of the form to add or delete a frame at that location. [Consult the Help topic on the Integrity Check form for more information]

<h2>Selecting the relevant portion of the light curve</h2>
As a general rule, it is not appropriate or desirable to archive the entire recording. Rather you will want to archive that part of the light curve which displays the actual event, together with sufficient data on either side of the event to be able to assess the noise characteristics. Guidelines are: <ul>

<li><B>Ordinary lunar occultation</B>: There will be a single transition lasting at most a small fraction of a second. Archive between 2 and 3 seconds of the light curve - with the event occurring close to the middle.

<li><B>Double star lunar occultation</B>: The light curve should extend from about 1 second before the first observed or expected event, to 1 second after the 2nd observed or expected event. However in situations where the time difference beteen the components is more than about 10 seconds, treat each component as a separate light curve.

<li><B>Grazing lunar occultation</B>: A difficulty with a grazing occultation is that there will be many events, and the limb slope will be different for each event. For this reason try to keep the light curves short so that only one event is included in each light curve. For partial events (that is, where the star partially disappears then reappears (or vice versa), the light curve should extend over the entire event.

<li><B>An asteroidal occultation</B>: For light curves where the signal-to-noise is 2 or more, it will usually be sufficient to include 5 seconds before and after the event. For events where the signal-to-noise is low (and particularly those events where the expected magnitude drop is small), a proper analysis of the light curve may involve a detailed characteristaion of the noise. In such situations the light curve should start at least 20 secs before the event, and end at least 20 secs after.</ul>

The selected portion of the light curve is highlighted in Aquamarine. The selected portion is set by clicking the mouse at the desired location. In the box labelled Set region to archive, there are radio buttons for Start and End. These operate with the mouse click to determine whether the point clicked is for the start or end of the selected region. The radio buttons automatically swap with each mouse click - so that you can set the start and end of the selected region without setting the radio buttons. However you can manually set the radio button as required.


<h1>Saving the light curve report</h1>
The file name for a saved report is displayed in brown at the right of the form. The file name is constructed as follows:<ul>
<li><B>Lunar occultation</B> SSSSSS_yyyymmdd_hhmmss-ss.dat - being the star number followed by the date and timne of the first data point in the selected portion of the light curve.

<li><B>Asteroidal occultation</B> (nnnn)_yyyymmdd_hhmmss-ss.dat - being the asteroid number followed by the date and time of the first data point in the selected portion of the light curve.</ul>

Click <B>Save this report</B> to save it. It will be saved in the subdirectory {Occult 4}/Observations/LightCurves. If you decide to change the start of the selected region after you have saved the light curve, the file name will be changed. In this situation you will need to manually delete the earlier saved file.
 
<h1>Submitting the light curve report</h1>
Light curve reports are submitted by email fromn within Occult. The reports being submitted are attached to an email and sent - with a bcc copy being sent to the sender. The individual reports are then moved from  <B>{Occult 4}/Observations/LightCurves </B>to <B> {Occult 4}/Observations/LightCurves/Reported</B>

There are two basic approaches to syub,itting reports<ul type=1>
<li>as soon as the report is prepared - using the <B>Save && Email this report </B>button. [This is not the preferred method, as it will result in too many individual reports for the person collecting the reports.]
<li>periodically, after multiple reports have been generated - using the button <B>Email multiple saved reports</B> on the report form, or the menu item<B> Light curve report... Email light curve reports</B>.</ul>

When using the Email Multiple reports:<ul type=a>
<li>From the directory listing that appears ( {Occult 4}/Observations/LightCurves} select all the light curve reports to be submitted, & click Open.
<li>After the email is sent, the selected files will be moved to the Reported subdirectory
<li>If you have saved light curve reports that have not been sent, Occult will remind you to send those reports. The frequency of that reminder is set in the User settings, under <B>2. Check availability of... </B>. The drop down box for 'Check for light curves to upload' provides options of Never, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, 3-monthly, and never. Monthly is recommended. Those times are computed with reference to the date of the previous upload. If there are no files to be uploaded, you will not receive any notice.
