<H1>Light curve simulator - asteroidal occultations</H1>
<!-- Insert Header in above line -->
<P>The light curve simulator provides a general simulator for asteroidal 
occultations. While it is particularly useful when the occulted star has a large 
diameter, it can be used for any occultation event.</P>
<P>The Simulator is mainly accessed via the form that displays the path of an 
occultation across the Earth - under the menu item <strong>Options... show Light 
Curve simulator</strong>. When accessed from here, the required details of 
the event are automatically passed to the simulator. It may also be accessed 
from the <strong>Occult main menu, Asteroid Predictions tab</strong> - where default values are 
used.</P>
<P>This is a plot of an occultation event involving a star with a large 
diameter: <span class="auto-style7">2023 Dec 12, (319) Leona occulting 
Betelgeuse</span>, using a preliminary ellipse for the expected orientation of 
the asteroid</P>

<p>[The Diameter and Limb Darkening of Betelgeuse have been taken from
<a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2014/12/aa23538-14/aa23538-14.html">
A&amp;A Volume 572, December 2014, A17&nbsp; Properties of.... Betelgeuse</a>, and 
the axes of Leona from a preliminary shape model of this asteroid.]</p>
<p>The<strong> <span class="auto-style5">Across-path</span></strong> plot shows the light curve in a direction 
across the path. While this plot is always symmetric, its orientation is 
important for the <span class="auto-style4">Along-path</span> light curve. For this purpose, the plot has the 
words <strong>LEFT</strong> and <strong>RIGHT</strong> near the bottom of the 
plot. These indicate the relevant side of the path when viewed along its 
direction of motion (which in this case is from East to West, such that <strong>
RIGHT</strong> corresponds to the northern side of the path).</p>
<p>The <span class="auto-style4">Across-path</span> plot has a red line which 
can be positioned using the slider under the plot. This is used to set the 
position of an observer for calculating the <span class="auto-style4">Along-path</span> 
light curve plot. The number in that line just above the km scale is the 
distance from the center line, in km.</p>

<p>The <strong><span class="auto-style5">Along-path</span></strong> plot is the expected light 
curve the observer would see from the across-path location set by the red line. 
When the asteroid is not represented as a circle, this light curve can become 
asymmetric, as shown in the above plot. This asymmetry is related to the 
orientation of the elongate asteroid relative to the path direction. </p>
<p>The possible shapes of the occultation curve are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For the majority of occultations, the star diameter is effectively zero. 
	As a result (and ignoring the effects of Fresnel diffraction) the light curve will drop 
almost vertically to the brightness of the asteroid, with a flat bottom - a <span class="auto-style6"><strong>
	Total</strong></span> occultation. </li>
	<li>When the star has an appreciable apparent diameter, three types of 
	occultations can occur:<ul>
		<li>If the star has an appreciable diameter, but is still smaller than the 
asteroid, the light curve will have a gradual decline and rise, with the central 
portion being at the asteroid light level (typically near zero). This is a <span class="auto-style6">
		<strong>Total occultation.</strong></span></li>
		<li>If the star has a diameter that is larger than the diameter of a 
	circular asteroid, or the largest diameter of a non-circular asteroid, the light curve 
will have a gradual decline and rise, with the central portion being flat. This 
		is an <span class="auto-style6"><strong>Annular occultation</strong></span>.&nbsp; 
		Importantly, when Limb Darkening is 
present/applied, the bottom of the central region will not be flat, but have a 
		gentle downward curve.</li>
		<li>for non-circular asteroids: if the major axis of the asteroid is 
		larger than the star, and the minor axis is smaller, at maximum 
		occultation on the center line the star disk will appear to&nbsp; 
		bisected by the asteroid (that is, with a crescents on both sides of the 
		asteroid body). This is a <span class="auto-style6"><strong>Bisected 
		occultation</strong></span>.</li></ul></ul>
		If the asteroid is 
non-circular (either an ellipse or a rectangle), the light curve 
in the <span class="auto-style4">Along-path</span> direction is only symmetrical 
on the central line. At any other location across the path, maximum occultation 
does not occur exactly mid-way between the start and end of the event. This is illustrated in the above plot; the location on the
<span class="auto-style4">Across-path</span> light curve (as set by the 
slider/red-line) is at the RIGHT (the northern limit for <em>this</em> event) of the total 
		occultation band, and the minimum of the <span class="auto-style4">Along-path</span> light curve occurs 
		later than the mid-time of the occultation at that location.

<h3>Controls below the plot</h3>
<p>These check boxes control the parameters used to generate the plot. If the 
simulator is opened from an <strong>event plot,</strong> many of these parameters will be set 
(including the label above the plots). If it is opened from the <strong>Asteroid 
Predictions</strong> tab of <strong>Occult</strong>, default values will be set</p>
<img src="Asteroid%20Predictions%20-%20LightcurveSimulator2.PNG" width="500">


<h3 class="auto-style3">Plot parameters</h3>


<li><strong>Asteroid motion - mas/sec.</strong> Used to set the time scale in the Along path plot. This 
rate of motion is used to set the time scale on the Along-path plot. When called 
from the event Path plot, this field is automatically set and can't be changed. </li>
<li><strong>Maximum duration</strong> This is a computed value, using the asteroid motion, and the major axis of the asteroid. 
For elliptic asteroids, the maximum duration occurs when the PA of the asteroid 
is 90° from the PA of the path.</li>
<li><strong>show Light level lines.</strong> When checked, light lines are drawn across the plot at several light levels</li>
<li><strong>show Magnitude lines.</strong> When checked, light lines are drawn across the plot at several magnitude drop levels</li>
<li><strong>show Distance and Time lines.</strong> When checked, light&nbsp; lines are drawn vertically across the plot at several distances (Across path) and times (Along 
path). The central line is emphasised.</li>
<li><strong>distances as Topocentric</strong> When checked, the Across-Path distance scale is adjusted to give an approximate distance on the Earth's surface. When not checked, the distances are on the 'fundamental plane'</li>


<h3 class="auto-style3">Star details</h3>
<li><strong>Diameter (mas)</strong> - the star's diameter. The minimum diameter that can be set is 0.1 mas.</li>
<li><strong>Limb darkening.</strong> Values can be in the range of -0.10 to +0.80. 
When there is no limb darkening, the value should be set to 0. Very strong limb 
darkening would be 0.8. Limb darkening is most relevant to red stars (spectral 
types K &amp; M), which are also the type of stars most likely to have a diameter 
sufficiently large for the effects of stellar diameter to be considered. For 
this reason, the default value of limb darkening is set at 0.05 (not 0)
<li><strong>Magnitude</strong> - the star's magnitude. Used with the asteroid's magnitude to set the magnitude drop taking into account the relative brightness of the two objects</li>. 
The magnitude type should be the same for both the star and asteroid - which 
usually means a V-magnitude should be used for the star.

<h3 class="auto-style3">Asteroid details</h3>
<li><strong>Model : Ellipse</strong> or <strong>Rectangular.</strong> Options for the shape form to 
represent the profile of the asteroid at the event. Ellipse is most commonly 
applicable. Rectangular is intended for asteroids like Kleopatra or Eros. In any 
event, select a model type most appropriate to the asteroid profile at event 
time.</li>
<li><strong>Major axis, km </strong>&amp; <strong>mas.</strong> The diameter of a circle, or the <em>major</em> 
axis of an ellipse or rectangle, representing the asteroid. Most likely you will 
know the dimensions in km - and you should enter values on that basis. The value in mas 
represents the apparent size, and is used for the light curve calculations. The values are linked - such that changing one value will change the other 
value.<strong> <span class="auto-style1">IMPORTANT. The typical unit for the 
asteroid size is km; make sure you enter the km values into the left field. The 
right field - diameter in mas) - will be automatically populated. </span>
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Minor axis, km or mas.</strong> The diameter of a circle, or the <em>minor </em>axis of an ellipse or rectangle, representing the asteroid. Other details are as 
for the Major axis.</li>
<li><strong>major axis PA°</strong> The position angle of the major axis of the ellipse or rectangle, referenced to the sky plane. This must be set manually.</li>
<li><strong>PA of path</strong> The position angle of the path direction, referenced to the sky plane. This is set automatically.</li>

<li><strong>Parallax</strong> - the asteroid's parallax. This is used to convert the asteroid diameters between mas and km. When called 
from the event Path plot, this field is automatically set and can't be changed. </li>

<li><strong>Magnitude</strong> - the asteroid's magnitude. Used with the star's magnitude to 
compute the magnitude drop taking into account the relative brightness of the two objects.</li>


<p>Apart from setting these values to the most reliable values available, you can get an appreciation of the effects of the various parameters by changing them. For example: 
with an elliptical asteroid of similar diameter to the star, change the PA you can see how the light curve 
changes as the orientation of the asteroid is changed (hint - hold down the up 
or down button on the PA control to have it cycle through the full range of 
values.) Or swap between the 
Ellipse and Rectangle models</p>
