<H1>Edit asteroid diameters</H1>
<P>The diameter of an asteroid is an important data element for asteroidal occultations 
- as it sets the path width and maximum duration. It is also relevant to lunar occultations 
in estimating the duration of any fading. Operationally the asteroid diameter is 
incorporated into the file of <A href="FileFormat%20AsteroidElements.htm">asteroid orbital elements</a>

whenever that file is created by converting one of MPCORB, AstDyS-2 or Astorb.<p>The asteroid diameter inserted in the file of asteroid diameter comes from the 
list of Infrared Satellite diameter measurements that are stored in the file <A href="FileFormat%20AsteroidDiameters.htm">
<strong>AsteroidDiameters.bin</strong></a>. If no diameter is provided in the file, the diameter is computed from the magnitude constant H0. This form is used to edit/insert 
a diameter in the file AsteroidDiameters.bin. Most users will have no reason to edit this file. 
That file will handle asteroids numbered in the range 1 to 550,000.<P>Upon opening, the form 
indicates asteroid #1, and shows its diameter. Change the asteroid number to the 
desired number, and the value of the diameter helkd in the file is displayed. To edit that diameter, 
simply enter the new value in the diameter field and click '<B>Replace entry'</B>. 
You will be asked to confirm before the change is written to the file.<P>&nbsp;<P>
<strong><span class="auto-style1">Note</span></strong>. The file <A href="FileFormat%20AsteroidDiameters.htm"><strong>
AsteroidDiametersAll.bin</strong></a>, which contains the individual measures from 
the various infrared astronomy satellites, is not changed as a result of the 
above edit, and is not otherwise editable.
