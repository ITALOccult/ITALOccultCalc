<H1>Satellite solution</H1>

If the event involves a binary asteroid, a floating panel appears on the form:<br>
<img Align=Middle Src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20Binaries.png"></p>

<p>This panel allows up to 4 satellites to be added. Simply use the up-button on the up/don control at the top of the form to add an extra satellite.

If you inadvertently add a non-existent satellite, you can delete it from the Observations Editor, using the menu item Solutions... 
Delete current event satellite solution(s).&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>For each satellite, you need to first fit the chords to the main body - as 
that is the reference point for the Separation and PA offsets. It can happen 
that only a satellite is recorded, and not the main body. In this situation you 
need to create an observation record in the main editor using the prediction 
from the main body, and in the Event Type block, check the box <strong>Satellite 
parent (unseen)</strong>.<p>&nbsp;Once that is done, you manually select the 
satellite (if there is more than one), select its name from the yellow box 
listing (if it isn't listed here, the designation field is left blank), specify its name or designation, then 
undertake a manual fit of the satellite ellipse (varying separation, Position 
angle, Major and Minor axes, and PA of the major axis - to get the best fit. You 
also need to specify the estimated uncertainties of the fit. Note that 
separations are in mas,&nbsp; PAs are in degrees, and the axes are in km.<p>If 
the event involves more than one satellite, you will also need to manually 
specify the number of chords for each satellite.<p>When you are satisfied with 
the fit, select the quality of the fit from the drop-down box.&nbsp; The options 
are:<table class="auto-style1" style="width: 700">
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 200px"><strong>None</strong></td>
		<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 356px">No fit to a/the satellite 
		has been made</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 200px"><strong>Is it a satellite?</strong></td>
		<td class="auto-style4" style="width: 356px">While the observation could 
		be explained by a satellite, there is no reasonable certainty that other 
		explanations have been excluded</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 200px"><strong>Approx offset</strong></td>
		<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 356px">An approximate offset (PA 
		and separation) can be derived, but the size is indeterminate</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 200px"><strong>Offset +&nbsp; size</strong></td>
		<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 356px">The satellite's size is 
		reasonably determined on the basis of it being spherical</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 200px"><strong>Offset + shape</strong></td>
		<td class="auto-style3" style="width: 356px">An ellipse can be fitted to 
		the satellite's profile</td>
	</tr>
</table>


<p>Finally, for a number of system orbits are available for the satellites. 
Where they are available the motions of the satellites can be allowed for in the 
overall event solution. The bottom part of the panel is only displayed if orbits 
are available. Click on the Get motion of satellite - from Miriade. Then from 
the list that appears select the appropriate satellite. This will transfer the 
motion of the satellite into the boxes at the bottom of the form.</p>
<p>Frequently Miriade will return results from several different orbit 
solutions. As a general rule, use the result first appearing in the list.</p>
