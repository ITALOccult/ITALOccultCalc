<p>This form is used to set the values in the AsteroidObservations file identifying the Minor Planet Circular number, and its date of publication, containing the summary of reported observations.

<p>This gives two options. </p>
<ol>
	<li><span class="auto-style5">Add MPC Observations ID</span>. This records 
	the date the observations were submitted to, and accepted by, the MPC - 
	together with the unique Observation ID</li>
	<li><span class="auto-style5">Add Minor Planet Circular number for the 
	observations.</span> This adds the MPC number containing the summary of the 
	observations.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;For both these options, locate the relevant email containing the list 
of Observation IDs (referred to above). Copy the entire text of that email 
(making sure all the ID's are included. (The presence of other text does not 
matter.) then click <span class="auto-style5"><strong>Paste observation ID's
</strong></span>This will populate the box will all the observation ID's.</p>
<p>The first option should be done soon after you have received the acceptance 
report from the MPC. It adds the date of submission, and the unique observation 
ID, to each observation included in the pasted list. To do this, make sure that 
option is checked; specify the <span class="auto-style6">Date of submission</span>, 
and click <span class="auto-style6">Add Observation ID's</span>. A scroll bar at 
the top of the screen will indicate progress. When the list is fully processed, 
it will be re-displayed with either a tick or cross after each line, to indicate 
whether the date and observation ID have been added to the event.</p>
<p>The 2nd option require keeping a watch on the Minor Planet 
Circulars to find when &amp; where they are published. The relevant address to 
retrieve the circulars is:
<a href="https://minorplanetcenter.net/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/MPCArchive_TBL.html">https://minorplanetcenter.net/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/MPCArchive_TBL.html</a> , with 
the relevant links being to the MPC######-### in the 2nd column - like<span class="auto-style6">

MPC</i><span>&nbsp;</span>177253-179246</a> The date in the first column provides an 
indication of the likelihood of the observations being in those MPC's</p>
<p>You can change the MPC details for an event from the observations editor, 
using the menu option <span class="auto-style6">File... MPC: Allow edit of date and MPC</span>. This will 
display a group of edit boxes at the right of the form, just above the list of 
observers</p>
