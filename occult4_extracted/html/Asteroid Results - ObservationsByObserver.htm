<H1>Display asteroid observations by an Observer</H1>
<P>This form is provided to assist observers with identifying their past 
observations. Also, to identify observations made by an observer when there is a 
need to edit their observations.<P>Apart from identifying observations by the 
observer's name, the form has three specific selection criteria - NTP for 
observations relying on NTP as the time source. Phone for using a telephone 
(mobile or fixed) as the time source, and Electronic for observations made using 
small aperture self-aligning telescopes with an electronic detector).<P> In the box at the top of the form, enter a string of characters contained in the observer's name (or 
perhaps location). Generally you should use a short string in preference to a long string - to 
minimize the consequences of data entry errors in the person's name. Similarly, select a string of characters in the family name - avoid first names (which may be converted to initials) and avoid using initials (which may or may not have a period after the initial). Note that the search is case insensitive.

<p>The output provides a block of two or more lines for each event where the observer filed matches the search string. 
<li>The first line identifies the event - asteroid number and name, date [yyyy mm dd] and star number.
<li>Subsequent lines in each event block lists each observer that matches the search string - giving the name, longitude, latitude and altitude.
<li>At the start of each observer line there are 3 numbers:
<ul><li>
	Pos -
a sequential count of events where the observer recorded one or more <strong>pos</strong>itive observations. If the observer 
	rcorded more than one positive observation at that 
event, those subsequent lines are indicated with a <strong>'+'.</strong> All Miss 
observations by the observer are indicated with a <strong>'-'</strong><li>
	Stn -
a sequential count of the number of <strong>st</strong>atio<strong>n</strong>s set up by the observer<li>
	ref -
the observation <strong>ref</strong>erence number in the Event observation data held in Occult.</ul>
<p>In the above example, the last block shows an event where the observer 
recorded 2 positive events, and 2 Miss events (the 1st being numbered; the 2nd 
being indicated with the '+').</p>
<p>The list can be copy, printed or saved using the File... menu item</p>
<p>At the end of the listing of sites by event, there is a listing of 'unique' 
sites used by the observer. </p>
<p>An example of such a listing is:</p>
<pre><br>8 Unique locations (Separation greater than 50 meters)<br><br>Longitude 
Latitude<br>+ 22 35 11.5 +37 15 34.7 Sites [ 3] 8, 4, 5, <br>+ 22 56 41.5 +37 31 13.4 Sites [ 1] 11, <br>+ 22 56 44.8 +37 31 13.6 Sites [ 1] 1, <br>+ 23 15 59.8 +38  4 44.9 Sites [ 1] 12, <br>+ 23 16 42.3 +38 10  4.4 Sites [ 3] 6, 9, 10, <br>+ 23 17  8.3 +38  9 16.0 Sites [ 1] 7, <br>+ 23 20 47.3 +37 30 35.4 Sites [ 1] 2,
<br>+ 23 48 20.0 +38 35 38.0 Sites [ 1] 3, </pre>
<p>The number in [ ] is the total number of observations made from that site, 
and the following numbers identify the corresponding Stn numbers in the listing 
by event. Sites are treated as being the same if they are within 50 meters of 
the first-listed site at that location.</p>
<p>The list of unique sites can be plotted in Google Earth using a button at the 
top of the form. This can assist in identifying possible transcription errors in 
site coordinates.</p>
<p>For observations made using the Electronic scope system, the listing includes five 
additional summary lists:</p>
<ul>
	<li>PART 1 Electronic observations by Observer name</li>
	<li>PART 2 Electronic observers with 2 or more POSITIVE observations</li>
	<li>PART 3 Electronic observers with 1 POSITIVE observation</li>
	<li>PART 4 Electronic observers with more than 1 observation - positive or 
	negative</li>
	<li>SUMMARY<br></li>
</ul>

<h2>Displaying sites in Google Earth
</h2>
There can be times where it is useful to plot all the site used by an observer in Google Earth. For example, such a plot can indicate inconsistencies in past site coordinates. It can also be used to quickly identify a previous site location near where one might want to travel to observe an event.

To plot all past observing sites in Google Earth, simply click the menu item  with 
<strong>List... Plot sites in GoogleEarth</strong>.<p>The labels on the GoogleEarth plot have two components separated by a slash (/). The first component is the sequential number used in the displayed list of sites. The second number is the record number in the relevant past event - again, as used in the displayed list of sites.</p>
