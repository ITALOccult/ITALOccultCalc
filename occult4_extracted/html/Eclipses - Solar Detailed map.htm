<H1>Solar eclipse - detailed map</H1>

<p>This option provides a map showing the eclipse path, for a location specified by the user. the plot region is controlled in several ways<ul>
<li>Set the nominal map boundaries (longitude and latitude limits) at the top of the form, then click <B>Draw map</B>.
 <li>Place the cursor on a point on the map that you would like to be in the centre, and double-click. </ul>

<p>The map is a conical projection, unless the region is very close to the pole. On the map, the line of central eclipse is drawn in purple; the limits of the umbral shadow are drawn in white; the penumbral limits, and curves of eclipse beginning or ending at maximum eclipse, sunrise or sunset are drawn in cyan.

<p>You can plot cites on the map, by selecting a site file from the drop-down box at the top. You can include names with the cities by selecting the relevant plot criteria in the drop-down box next to the list of site files.

<p>The map has a right-click menu that is almost the same as for the world map. The functions are:
<table columns=3 border=1>

<TR><TD>Local Prediction</TD><TD>Generates a local prediction.  <A href="Eclipses%20-%20Solar%20-%20Local%20prediction.htm">Details</a> If selected using the right-click menu, the local prediction is calculated for the location of the cursor.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Multilocation Prediction</TD><TD>Generates eclipse predictions for multiple sites, using site files <A href="Eclipses%20-%20Solar%20-%20Multilocation.htm">Details</a></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Path coordinates</TD><TD>Generate the path coordinates for the umbra and penumbra, including central path circumstances. <A href="Eclipses%20-%20Solar%20-%20Path%20coordinates.htm">Details</a></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Set-up Baily Beads for animation</TD><TD>This opens up the Baily Beads module, and sets the basic parameters required to generate an animation for the location set by the cursor, and runs an animation. Note that this is intended for locations near to the central path. If less than half the diametrer of the sun is covered by the moon, the animation will not display. <A href="Baily%20Beads%20-%20main.htm">Details</a> (see end)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Lunar profile - generate & Save</TD><TD>You can generate and save the lunar limb for the current Mouse location. The file is saved in the <B>Predictions </B>subfolder, with a file name  of MoonLimb_yyyyMMMddLongxxxLatyyy.txt. The first two lines of the file give details of the date/time/location, and librations. Following are 360 lines for each degree in Axis angle, with each line having 100 values of the topocentric limb height at 0.01° in Axis angle and a height resolution of 0.01"

<TR><TD>View in Google Earth</TD><TD>Displays the eclipse path outline curves in GoogleEarth - where (for example) you can zoom into any location along the eclipse path to investigate possible observing locations.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Save GoogleEarth kmz file</TD><TD>Creates a kmz file for use with GoogleEarth, that displays the eclipse path outline curves.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Save Google Maps HTM file</TD><TD>Creates an HTM file for use with GoogleMaps, that displays the eclipse path outline curves.</TD></TR>
