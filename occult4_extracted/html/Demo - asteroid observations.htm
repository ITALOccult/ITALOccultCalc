<H1>Demonstration - asteroid occultation observations</H1>

<h2>1. Summaries of results</h2>
<ul type=1>
<li>From the Main menu, click the <B>Asteroid Observations </B>tab. 
<li>Click the <B>Observed Diameters</B> button to view a listing of all derived diameters.
<li>Click the <b>Observed chords</b> button to list all asteroids for which one or more asteroidal occultations has been observed. SElecting an asteroid will result in a display of the individual observed chord lengths - which might be used to analyse the diamter and shape of the asteroid.
<li>Click the <B>Double star discoveries</B> button to list all double star discoveries made in asteroid occultations.
<li>Click the <B>Derived asteroid positions </B>button to view a list of astrometric positions derived from the observations.
<li>Click the <B>Events involving distant asteroids </B>to list all such events.
<li>Click <B>observations by an observer</B>. At the top of the form, enter a string of characters to search for, then click Search. Inspect the list of events found.
<li>Click <b>Generate Graphics files for Many events</b> to open a form which enables you to select a range of asteroidal occultation events, and save the graphic of all those events. [This function is mainly for publication and archiving purposes.]</ul>

<h2>2. Edit/view observations of an occultation</h2>
<ul type=1>
<li>On the main form, click the <B>Add/Edit/Plot observed asteroidal occultations</B>. This opens the observations editor.
<li>At the top right of the form, note the <B>Historical Observations</B> box. Observations are selected using the large drop-down box. The other controls in the box change the list of observations which are included in the large drop-down box. 
<li>We will now view an occultation by Interamnia. Select the <B>Name </B>option, then the letter I. From the large drop-down box you will see several occultations by Interamnia. Select the event with 71 observations.
<li>At the bottom of the form, the individual observations are displayed.   As you 
change the selected event, you can see how the edit fields change.
<li>Above the list of observation the solution for the asteroid size, and double star details (if any) are displayed. At the right, the text <B>MPC60649 of 2007 9 26 </B>indicates that the astrometric position has been reported to the Minor Planet Center.

<br><br><li>In the menu, select <B>with Observations... Plot sites in GoogleEarth</B>. Note two groups of observers - one in Japan, and the other in Hawaii. Note how you can easily identify data entry errors in site coordinates. 


<br><br><li>In the menu bar, click <B>Plot event</B>. The results of the occultation are displayed.
<li>The menu option <B>Plot options </B>contains many plot options. Try each to see the effect.
</ul>
<h2>3. Light curve analysis</h2><ul>
<li>On the main form, click <B>Star diameter analyser</B>. This opens up a tool for analysing multiple occultation light curves to derive a diameter for the occulted star.
<li>On the main form, click <B>Light curve simulator</B>. This opens up a tool for simulating the occultation light curve when the star has an appreciable diameter, and is more than about 10% of the diamter of the asteroid. The simulator involves three forms. One is an overall control form. The second is a form for drawing the shape of teh asteroid, and the apparent path of the star against the asteroid, The third form displays the light curve. THe 2nd and third form have variable transparency - so that they can be overlaid against the asteroid reduction plot to draw the asteroid shape, and to overly the light curve over the observed light curve to assess the goodness of the fit.
