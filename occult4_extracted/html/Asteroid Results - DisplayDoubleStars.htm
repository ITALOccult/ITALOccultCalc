<H1>Double stars observed in occultations</H1>
<P>This provides a list of double stars recorded in an asteroid occultation
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Main display</h3>
<img src="Asteroid%20observations%20-%20DoublesDisplay.PNG" width="900">



<p>The information provided is:
<li>The WDS 10-character identifier</li>
<li>The star number</li>
<li>Magnitudes of the star used as the primary, and the other star</li>
<li>The solution number. The number of possible solutions are 1, 2 and 4.</li>
<li>Separation and uncertainty, in milli-arcsecs. Where no ± value is given, the solution is not strongly determinative</li>
<li>PA and uncertainty, in degrees. Where no ± value is given, the solution is not strongly determinative</li>
<li>RUWE of the star. Provided to assess the degree of correspondence of RUWE and the star being a double star</li>
<li>The date of the observation</li>
<li>Asteroid number and name.</li>
<li>Publication information - whether it is in the WDS catalog, and the publication details in the Journal of Double Star 
Observations</li>
<li>The observers of that event. All observers are listed, irrespective of whether they recorded 
both, one, or other of the components, or had a complete miss observation</li>
The Display menu options (below) varies what data is actually displayed
<p>
</p>
<h3>WDS summary line</h3>
<img src="Asteroid%20observations%20-%20DoublesDisplayWDS.PNG" width="900">
<p>
This displays the data in the standard WDS catalogue format.</p>
<p> The end of each line indicates when the star is in the WDS catalog, or has been published in the 
Journal Double Star Observations (JDSO)</p>
<h3>WDS submission line</h3>
<img src="Asteroid%20observations%20-%20DoublesDisplayWDSsubmit.PNG" width="900">
<p>
This displays the data in the format needed for direct submission to the WDS.</p>
<p> The end of each line indicates when the star is in the WDS catalog, or has been published in the 
Journal Double Star Observations (JDSO)</p>

</p>
<h2>Sort</h2>

<img src="Asteroid%20observations%20-%20DoublesSortOptions.PNG" width="300">
<br>These tables can be sorted by any of these options.
<p></p>
<h2>Display </h2>
<p>The output can be filtered on the following bases</p>
<img src="Asteroid%20observations%20-%20DoublesDisplayOptions.PNG" width="300">
<p>The first 6 options do not apply to the displays of either the 
<span class="auto-style1">WDS Submission line</span>, or<span class="auto-style1"> WDS Summary line</span>.
<br>The 4 options of<span class="auto-style1"> Exclude...</span>, and the 
<span class="auto-style1">Unsolved doubles </span>option, apply to all displays</p>

<h2>Unsolved doubles</h2>
There may be stars listed as doubles, where the double star information has not been completed in the relevant event. Such stars are excluded from the normal listing - in all formats. If the <strong>Unsolved doubles</strong> option is checked, the stars that are unsolved (and only those stars) will be displayed. 'Obviously', the dopuble star solution for these stars need to be undertaken in the 
Observation Editor.


<h2>Filter by observer name</h2>

<p>The name filter box allows observations by a particular observer to be 
listed. If there are any characters in this box, they will be used for any 
display of the data that is not a WDS Submission or Summary line.</p>
<p>The filter applies a simple test of whether any of the observer names for 
an event contain the string of characters specified in the Name Filter box. It does 
not use wild cards. While you can enter names in upper/lower case, the search is 
conducted on a case-insensitive basis</p>
<h2>Displaying light curves</h2>
<p>When the display includes the 'Double star solutions' line, you can display all available light cirves for that event by<br>
<li>selecting an event line, and

<li>either right-click, or double-click, on it.</li>
<h2>Saving light curves as image files</h2>
<p>If you want to create image files for the light curves of an event, click the option button 'Save Images' on the menu bar, then re-display the light curves (with a right-click or double click). The file name will be the text of the header line in the light curve image, and the default directory will be an Occult subfolder LightCurvePlots. The user will have to confirm the file name and location as each file is saved.</p>

<p>Users will need to manually manage the number of image files held in this subfolder. </p>
