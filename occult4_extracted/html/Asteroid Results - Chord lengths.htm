<H1>Chord lengths in Asteroidal Occultations</H1>
<P>This form provides a list of the length of each observed chord for all observed occultations of any particular asteroid.

<p>The left panel provides a list of all asteroids that have been observed in occultation (Name + asteroid number), the number of occultation events, and the diameter as given by either AKARI AcuA, or IRAS.

<p>To list the observed chord lengths for an asteroid - simply select the asteroid in the left panel. The observed chord lengths, together with the observer identification, are listed in the right panel - under the date for each event.

<p>The list makes no judgment about the reliability of any chord length. It merely lists all chords corresponding to all observations that are marked to be plotted in the observation record. Naturally, a chord is only listed when there is both a D and R event time.



<p>&nbsp;A list of the satellite measured diameters is provided at the end



<p>The list will also contain an estimate of the diameter of an asteroid when 
there are 3 or more chords - even if they occur over different events. The 
approach was developed by <span class="auto-style1"><strong>John Broughton</strong></span>, 
and can be simply expressed as:<ul>
	<li>find the mean value of the length of all chords - the 1st mean</li>
	<li>find the mean value of all chords greater than 70% of the first mean - 
	the 2nd mean</li>
	<li>the approximate diameter is 1.27 times the 2nd mean</li>
</ul>
