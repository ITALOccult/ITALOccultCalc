<H1>AOTA: Tab 4. Select event to analyse</H1>

The cross-correlation investigation will have identified possible occultation events, and provided information to assist the user in deciding whether or not an 'event' was a real occultation. The determination of the times to be associated with the event involves a completely different analysis, which must be run for each 'event'. Under this tab the user selects an event to be analysed in detail. <p>
<img src = "AOTA_SelectEvent.png"><p>
The tab form displays five rows of possible events under five columns:<ul>
<li>A check-box under the heading <B>Plot</B> to plot the possible occultation event associated with that line (as a black dashed line), and to activate the controls on that line
<li>A radio button under the heading <B>Add/Edit</B> to control whether to add a new event, or modify the location of an existing event
<li>A box under the heading <B>Posn</B> that gives the location along the light curve of the centre of the event 
<li>A box under the heading <B>Width</B> that gives the width of the event in frames (or plot points) 
<li>A button with the caption <B>Analyse #x</B>, which is clicked to analyse that event.
<li>A check-box used to set (or clear) the possible event as a 'non-event' (followed by a single button to set all 5 check boxes to a 'non-event').</ul>

The first line in the list is automatically checked (with non-event clear). It corresponds to the most likely event found in the Cross-correlation search.

<p>Any other possible events found in the search are listed with positive values for the Posn and Width is similarly indicated. Usually fewer than 5 possible occultations will be found (usually only one!), and the values in Posn and Width are set to -1 when there is no associated possible occultation.

<p>If in the final analysis (tab 6) an event is marked as a 'non-event', that setting can be cleared from the 'non-event' listing in this tab. In this situation the event should be re-analysed.

<p>The location of any event - except the first event - can be changed by checking the relevant radio button, moving the cursor to a point along the plot, and clicking. The details of the Position and width, corresponding to the peak cross-correlation value at the location of the cursor, will now be displayed. Also the occultation event will be displayed if the check box is checked.

<p>An event is treated as a MISS event if (and only if) all possible events are set as 'non-Event'. A button <B><I>Set ALL as 'Non-Event' </I></B>is provided to set all events as a non-Event. Users should not be too hasty to set all events as non-events. For example, it is possible for the first event to be a Non-Event for a reason such as cloud, with a later-listed event being a 'real' event.

<h3>Manual event identification</h3>
It may be that the cross-correlation curve shows a number of peaks within the Peach band at the bottom, and you would like to get a sense of what a possible occultation at that point might be like - or indeed do a full analysis. You can investigate this by <ul type=i>
<li>checking a <B>Plot </B>checkbox (other than the first) - typically on a line with no associated event. 
<li>check the radio button on that line to enable the <B>Add/Edit </B>functionality for that line
<li>point the cursor to a point of interest along the cross-correlation curve (usually a peak on that curve) and click.</ul>
You will now see the <I>possible event </I>drawn on the plot; the position and width of that <I>event </I>are displayed in the Posn and Width boxes.

<p>You can add multiple possible events by repeating this process using different lines.

<p>If the radio button is on the first line, no changes to the Posn and Width on that line are made. 

<p>You can analyse any event selected in this manner by clicking the corresponding <B>Analyse #... </B>button.

<p>Remember that you can overlay the plot with any comparison stars that have been measured. This may assist with assessing whether a peak is a real event.

<p> Note that this process will give rise to a <I>possible event</I> at every point along the light curve. It is very unlikely that such events are 'real' events. Remember that there will rarely be more than one 'real' event in a light curve - which means that there must be some reason to select a particular point along the light curve over any other point (with the primary consideration being the shape of the cross-correlation curve). Coincidence with a predicted time does <B><I>not </I></B>constitute a relevant reason.
