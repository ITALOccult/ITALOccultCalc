<H1>Find occultations of a particular object</H1>

<h2>Generate event list</h2>
<P>Under this form you can investigate occultations of particular objects over any period of time. 
The period of time is set at the top of the form, in years. While you could set a very large time periods, generally a period of less than 20 years is appropriate, noting that the Saros period of the moon is 18 years.</P>

<p><B>Stars </B>- the form allows you to select a star from a list (with the list being any one of 6 lists) or using the star's ZC, SAO or XZ number. Click 'Find Star' to list all occultations and possible occultations</p>

<p><B>Planets </B>- select the relevant planet. Then click 'Find Planet' to list all occultations and possible occultations</p>

<p><B>Asteroids </B>- the form allows you to select an asteroid from a list. The list is of all asteroids in the <a href="User%20asteroids%20edit.htm">User file of Asteroids</a>. Click 'Find Asteroid' to list all occultations and possible occultations.<UL>
<B>Warning</B>: For this option, the program needs to integrate the orbit to the relevant date. You should avoid looking for occultations over a long period of time at a time in the distant past or future.</ul></p>

<p><B>J2000 coordinates </B>- this option allows investigation of miscellaneous objects. for example:
<li>a bright nova is discovered near the ecliptic. Enter the J2000 coordinates, and find out if it will be occulted.
<li>you are interested in bright open clusters - such as the Pleiades or Praesepe. Select the relevant cluster from the drop-down box to retrieve the coordinates. The magnitude given is of the brightest star in the cluster.
<li>you are interested when an object like M1 will be next occulted. Enter the J2000 coordinates, and find the occultation dates. [The next series of occultations of M1 is between 2011 June 2 and 2012 Oct 6.]<br>Click 'Find Object' to list all occultations and possible occultations.</p>

<h2>Display an event</h2>
<p>Once the event list is populated, there are a number of options to view the event - accessed by right-clicking on the event. you can:<ul>
<li>plot the Occult world map showing the occultation path
<li>view the occultation path in Google Earth
<li>save a '.kmz' file for use with GoogleEarth
<li>save a '.htm' file for use with GoogleMaps.</ul>
<B>Important</B>. When you view an event under any of these options, a precise calculation of the occultation elements of the object (including moons of Jupiter and Saturn) occurs and are resident in the form for predicting local occultations. If you now open the local prediction form, you can generate local predictions of the event, using any of your site files. If the object is Jupiter or Saturn, their moons are also available for precise local predictions.</p>

<h2><br>Display ALL events</h2>
<p>An additional option is to display ALL the listed events as small occult maps on a single form. This provides a simple facility to inspect all occultations of an object to identify those of interest. For example, you could search for all occultations of Saturn between 2007 and 2017, and see that the only occultation that occurs in the USA is on 2014 Aug 31 (and then only in the eastern half in daylight) and in Europe on 2014 Oct 25 at low altitudes). Or you could investigate the last time &#946 Gem (Pollux) was occulted [hint - it was between 100BC and 200BC.]</p>
<p>The form displays 3 maps on each line. Occasionally a map location will be blank - with a message that no occultation occurs. This occurs because the list of events is not based on a precise calculation, and includes some events where there is no occultation. However the map is based on a precise calculation and while the map is drawn for 'close' miss events, it is not drawn when the event is a wide miss.</p>

<p>Once drawn, the maps can be copied to the clipboard, or saved. If you want to print them you need to paste/open the maps in a different application.</p>
