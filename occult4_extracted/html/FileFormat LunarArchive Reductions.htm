 61    : (A1)     Phenomena
                    &lt&gt  not specified
                     D  disappear
                     R  reappear
                     B  Blink. The mid-time of a blink event. Usually only occurs during a graze,
                           but can occur in near-graze situations. Duration is specified at 
                            column 48.
                           (video) partial disappearance (always &gt 25% of full light). 
                           (visual) a short disappearance-reappearance - too close to separately
                            time.
                     F  Flash. The mid-time of a flash event. Usually only occurs during a graze,
                           but can occur in near-graze situations. Duration is specified at
                            column 48.
                           (video) partial reappearance (always &lt 25% of full light). 
                           (visual) a short reappearance-disappearance - too close to separately
                            time.
                     M  Miss. The time when the star was adjacent the highest point on the
                          observed or predicted graze profile û although the time might also be
                          simply the mid-time of the graze. Usually only used when other
                          observers in a graze observation have recorded D &amp/or R events
                     S  Start or resume. Only used in a graze observation, to indicate periods
                          when the observer was observing.
                     E  End or pause. Only used in a graze observation, to indicate periods when
                          the observer was not observing.
                     O  Other [used by ILOC instead of S or E]
                     X  Missing data. A grazing occultation of this star was known to have been
                          successfully observed on this date, but no observations are available.
                          The time and site coordinates are indicative only.

                     F  Valid, after adjustments to site coordinates AND star number.
                     G  Valid, after adjustments to site coordinates AND star number AND date/time.
                          [NOTE for codes D, E, F & G: Adjustments to site coordinates are made on
                           the basis of ALL observations made from a site, and not on an
                           event-by-event basis.]

                     S  Unknown site location. [Used for RGO and ILOC data, where there
                           is no site data for the specified station.]
                     T  Poor time base [for events before 1850]
                     U  Unidentified star [including star is not in the XZ80Q catalogue]
                     W  Invalid site location. The site location is definitely
                           in error (eg site located in the sea, or all 
                           observations from the location have large residuals), and the
                           correct location cannot be deduced (eg obvious transposition
                           of digits in the reported site coordinates).
                     X  Assessed as an invalid observation. On investigation, confident the
                          relevant occultation and observing location has been identified,
                          with a conclusion that the event was not actually observed for 
                          some reason - such as difficult conditions.
                     Y  limb-corrected residual greater than about 4". This is a flag 
                          automatically generated to indicate the computed residual is
                          unsatisfactory. The exact criteria applied depends on the basis for
                          correcting the limb for its irregularities. Events with this flag
                          have not been individually investigated to determine whether there
                          is an error in the reported data, or whether the observation was
                          adversely affected by poor observing conditions (that is, is invalid).
                     Z  Unresolved data errors. After considering the possibility
                          of errors in several of date + time, star, and site location, 
                          the reported observation cannot be plausibly associated with a
                          relevant occultation.
