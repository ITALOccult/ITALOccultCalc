<H1>Select star</H1>

<P>This form is used to select the star to be used in graze predictions, multi-site predictions, and World Map predictions.</P>
<p>The list of stars can be quite large at times. To make it easier to locate the relevant star in the list, use a subset of the XZ catalogue that doesn't include many stars fainter than the particular star.</p>
<p><B>Ordering of stars.</B> Stars are ordered by increasing RA.  That means that you will need to carefully scan through the list to find a particular star. Note that ZC stars have 4 or fewer digits, SAO stars have 5 or 6 digits, and XZ stars can have any number of digits, but are 
preceded with an "X".</p>

<p>For graze predictions, make sure you complete the graze parameters AND select a star.</p>
