<H1>Lunar limb map</H1>
<P>You can view the region of the moon that forms the lunar profile at the point of an occultation, from above. This is done from the plot of the lunar limb profile - either as a graze profie, or from the Main Menu selection Lunar Occultation Observations ... Plot observations against the Lunar Limb. Simply place the cursor at a pont along the profile, right-click, and select <B>Plot limb region for this Axis Angle</B>.

<p>The following images show the map generated by Occult (from a graze observed on 2007 Sept 24) over the crater Hausen, and an extract from <B>Atlas of the Moon </B>by <I>Anton&#237n R&#252kl </I>showing the same portion of the moon.

<h2>Basis of the map</h2>
The coordinates used for the map is the [P,D] coordinate system. This is a polar system with the pole pointing towards the Earth, and located at selenographic longitude 0°, latitude 0°. The <B>P</B> coordinate is measured anticlockwise around the lunar limb, with the zero intersecting the lunar north pole. The <B>D</B> coordinate is measured from the 'pole' pointing towards the earth, and the pole pointing away - from +90° to -90°. In this coordinate system, the P cooordinate is usually within 1° of the Axis Angle, while the D coordinate of points on the lunar limb is usually within the range ±10°.

<p>The limb plot is of a fixed size. It covers 6° on the P coordinate, and 12° in the D coordinate. The P coordinate for the centre of the plot is determined by the point along the graze profile that is selected for the plot. The D coordinate at the centre of the plot is set by the lunar librations used to generate the graze profile. The values of P and D covered in the plot are set out at the top left of the plot.

<p>The direction of view over the moon's surface for the selected Axis Angle on the graze profile is shown as a dashed green line. Generally it is inclined to the vertical, with the amount being determined by the librations.  Arrows at the top and bottom of the plot indicate the direction of view. 

<p>The plot has two controls accessed from the menu bar. The basis of the plot is that a line is drawn for set values of the D coordinate, with the height of the profile being represeted by a displacement of the line.<ul type=a>
<li><I>Resolution</I>. This sets the interval between the D values that are plotted. Resolution <B>1</B> plots D values at intervals of 0.02°; Resolution <B>2</B> plots D values at intervals of 0.04°; and Resolution <B>3</B> plots D values at intervals of 0.06°; 
<li><I>Height</I>. This sets the amount by which the line is displaced in accordance with the profile height. Height <B>1</B> is  the basic amount. Heights <B>2</B> and <B>3</B> increase the displacenment by factors of 2 and 3 respectively. </ul>
The above plot was generated with Resolution = 2 and Height = 1.

<p>The plot optionally shows the points that actually create the lunar profile - as red dots (as shown in the above plot).  This can be enabled/disabled using <B>...with Map, Show limb points</B>. These points are correctly plotted against the lunar features as plotted. To see the extent of displacement caused by the plotting of the profile, <B>with Map..., Show height lines for limb points</B>. This will show blue lines connecting the red dots to the true [P,D] coordinate of the relevant feature.

<p>The cursor when on the plot has a 'tooltip' which gives the current Axis Angle, [P,D] coordinates, and the height of the mean lunar surface (as specified in the LOLA dataset) below the line of sight. For accurate measures of the [P,D] coordinates of a point on the graze profile, make sure <B>with Map..., Show height lines for limb points</B> is checked, and measure the end of the blue line for the selected point.. [This is because the height of the lunar profile is indicated by a displacement on the plot that is indistinguished form the D coordinate.] 

<p>The scale of the plotted map can be varied using the scroll bar at the top of the form. Additionally, the scale can be changed by changing the width of the form (by dragging one or other side).
