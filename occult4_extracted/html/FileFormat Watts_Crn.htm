<P>The file WATTS.CRN contains data for correcting the Watts charts for the corrections given in <A href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1981MNRAS.196.1005M" target = _blank><I>Morrison & Appleby </I><B>MNRAS</B> (1981) 196, 1013-1020</a>. The data stored are the values indicated in Fig 3 of that paper (on page 1016), and are stored as two-byte signed integers. The order of storing the data is:<ul>

<li>Quantities in order

dR0, dX, dY, dR2

<li>Within each quantity, the values are ordered by librations in longitude and latitude.  The values are ordered firstly by l, in accordance with:<br>

L = -7.5, -4.5, -1.5, +1.5, +4.5, +7.5


<li>Then, for each value of L, the data is ordered by B in accordance with<br>

B = -6.5, -3.5, -0.5, +2.5, +5.5<br>

(ie  there are 6 values of L, each accompanied by 5 values of B, for each quantity).
