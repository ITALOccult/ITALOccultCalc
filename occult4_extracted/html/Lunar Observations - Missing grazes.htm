<H1>Missing grazes</H1>
Regrettably a number of successful grazing occultation observations are not included in the Archive of lunar occultation observations. The likely reasons for this are:<ul type=1>
<li>The observations were sent to ILOC or RGO, but never received;
<li>The observations were forwarded to the graze coordinator. However  due to delays in finalising the complete report (typically associated with seeking clarification from one or more observers) the coordinator ended up forgetting to forward the report to ILOC or RGO
<li>While a successful observation was made, the observer has not gotten around to preparing an observation report.
</ul>
<p>The existence of such grazes has been established as a result of comparing the lists of successful grazes reported in the Occultation Newsletter against the data actually in the Archive. This list has been augmented by some more recent grazes falling into the 3<sup>rd</sup> category.
<p>The List Missing Grazes option from the main menu provides a current listing of all grazes known to have been observed but for which no observations are available. ANyone who has observations for any of these grazes is urged to forward a copy to their regional lunar occultation coordinator.
