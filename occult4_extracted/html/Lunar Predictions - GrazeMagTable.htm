<H1>Magnitude table</H1>
<P>The magnitude visibility table gives the faintest magnitude that will be visible at that cusp angle with different telescope apertures, assuming good observing conditions. An example of the table is:
<pre>
At longitude 40.00:
Limiting Magnitudes for various telescope apertures (in cm)
      CA\Tdia   5    10    15    20    25    30    35
     1.7      2.8   4.1   4.9   5.3   5.5   5.7   5.8
     3.7      4.5   5.9   6.7   7.1   7.4   7.6   7.8
     5.7      4.7   6.1   6.8   7.3   7.6   7.8   7.9
     7.7      5.4   6.8   7.5   8.0   8.3   8.5   8.7
     9.7      5.4   6.8   7.5   8.0   8.3   8.5   8.7</pre>

<p>The first line gives the longitude along the graze path used for the generation of the table. You can generate the table for any location along the path and this can be important to allow for changes in cusp angle, or star altitude.
<p>The third line of the table provides column headers. CA is the Cusp Angle of the star. Tdia refers to Telescope diameter (in cm) which, in the 7 columns of the body of the table cover telescope apertures from 5cm to 35 cm.

<p>The 5 lines of the body of the table correspond to the cusp angle of the star. The third line is set as the Cusp Angle of the graze at the selected longitude [or at the mid-point of the listed graze path in the prediction.] The preceding and following lines can be used in conjunction with the graze profile to indicate visibility of the star during the course of the graze.

<p>The organiser of a graze expedition can use this table to:
<li>Indicate the minimum telescope aperture required to observe the graze (Either the whole graze. Or just one half of a graze that is close to the cusp); and
<li>Allocate sites to observers, in a way that maximises the number of successful timings made during the graze.

<p>Assume for this example that the star was of magnitude 5.0. This table indicates that the part of the graze that occurs furthest from the cusp will be visible in almost any telescope. However, when the star is close to the cusp, it will be more difficult to observe and might require a 20cm (8”) telescope. The organiser might locate observers with medium-size telescopes closest to the graze limit confident that they will see all events because the star will always be some distance from the cusp. They might locate observers with large telescopes further in from the graze path, in the knowledge that they will be able to record the whole graze because with their telescope they will be able to see the star when it is close to the cusp. They might also locate observers with small telescopes in a similar region to the large telescopes in the expectation that they will not see the star while it is near the cusp, but will have no difficulty with the part of the graze where the star is a long way from the cusp (when  would in fact be easier to see than if the observer was located closer to the graze path.)
