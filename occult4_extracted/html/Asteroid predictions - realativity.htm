<H1>Relativistic deflection</H1>
<p>The observed direction of all objects is affected by the gravitational field of the sun. The amount of deflection is dependant upon how close the light path is to the sun, and the length of that light path. A particular result is that when an asteroid is aligned with a star (as in an occultation) the relativistic deflection of the light from the two objects will be different - as the light path from the asteroid has not travelled as far thrrough the Sun's gravitational field. As a result, the Sun's gravitational field results in a small <I>relative </I>deflection in  the apparent directions of the star and asteroid.

<p>This form displays the extent of the relative deflection. The required data are the star's coordinates, the distance to the asteroid (in AU) and the date. The routine calculates the position of the Sun, and displays the deflection of the asteroid relative to the star. The deflection is given in milli-arcsecs. Note that while the effect of relativistic deflection is to make both the star and asteroid appear further from the sun, the asteroid is not deflected as much as the star. That is, relative to the star, the asteroid will always be displaced towards the sun.

<p>In almost all cases the extent of relativistic deflection will be too small to have any significant effect on predictions.
