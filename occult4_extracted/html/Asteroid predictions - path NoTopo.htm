<H1>Topographic path not available</H1>
<P>A topographic occultation path implies a very high accuracy in the prediction.</P>
<P>Occult has been developed to provide efficient searching for occultation 
events. This involves a numerical integration scheme to ensure the orbital 
elements for the asteroid are appropriate for each day being considered. However 
that scheme is only a basic scheme. To get the best predictions, one must access 
the orbital elements from JPL Horizons. Furthermore, one has to have the 
elements appropriate to the time of the event, and not trigger the integration 
scheme in Occult.</P>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This message is advising that the occultation prediction you are using has 
been generated within Occult, but has not taken the step necessary to obtain a 
full-accuracy prediction. To generate the required accuracy:</p>
<ul>
	<li>return to the List and Display form</li>
	<li>Select the relevant event line</li>
	<li>right-click on that line. Read the message, then click OK</li>
</ul>
<p>Occult will retrieve a new set of elements from Horizons, and generate a new 
prediction. The List &amp; Display form will turn light blue, and only the event of 
interest will be displayed. Select that event and a new world map will show. 
From there, select path Coordinates again, and the function to compute using 
local topography will be enabled.</p>
