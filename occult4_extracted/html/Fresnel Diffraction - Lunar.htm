<H1>Fresnel diffraction - Lunar occultations</H1>

<p>When an occultation of a bright star occurs, Fresnel diffraction effects may be visible. Fresnel diffraction is the light intensity pattern that occurs at the edge of an object. Approaching the edge of the object from the unobscured side, the light intensity oscillates with increasing intensity until it rapidly falls off. At the location corresponding to the edge of the object, the light intensity has reduced to 0.25 of the full illumination. The light intensity continues to fall off in an exponential manner as one moves into the fully obscured region.

<p>Where a large magnitude drop occurs, the exponential drop in the light intensity will be observable and can be confused with the effects of stellar diameter. The following table lists the angular distance from the true edge of the moon for a given magnitude drop for the star. Distances are in meters, and arcsecs
<pre>
Mag Drop	Light drop	metres	asec	
1	.40		3	0.002	
2	.16		5	0.003	
3	.063		8	0.004	
4	.025		13	0.007	
5	.010		20	0.010	
6	.0040		32	0.017	
7	.0016		50	0.026	
8	.0006		80	0.041	
9	.0003		126	0.066	
10	.0001		200	0.104

<p>As can be seen from this table, Fresnel diffraction can become significant if the observable magnitude drop is 
&gt;5 magnitudes - especially in grazing occultations.
