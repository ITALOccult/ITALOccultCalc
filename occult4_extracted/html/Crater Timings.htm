<H1>Crater timing reductions</H1>
<P>This functionality reduces Crater Timing observations made during lunar eclipses, to compute the height of the notiuonal eclipse-forming layer above the Earth's geoid, and the percent enlargement of the umbral shadow. The methodology is set out in <B>Analysis of Lunar Crater Timings 1842-2011</B>, <I>D Herald and R Sinnott</I>,  JBAA, (in print, expected at end of 2014). 

<p>The routine operates on a file of observations having the following format:

The dataset of observations from 1842 to 2011 in this format will be available from Vizier as catalogue VI/140. 

<p>Also required is a file of crater coordinates and diameters that conatins all the craters and other features in the file. This file is 
called <i>CraterTimings.bin</I>, and has been created from the <B>Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature </B>
maintained by the <I>Inernational Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for
Planetary System Nomenclature</I>. The format for this file (which stores the data as binary) is:

<pre>Byte(s): (Format) Description
  1-  2: (int16)   Selenographic longitude of the center of the crater, in units of 0.01deg.
  3-  4: (int16)   Selenographic latitude of the center of the crater, in units of 0.01deg
  5-  8: (int32)   radius of the Crater in km
  9- 28: (A20)     Name of lunar feature</pre>  

A version of <I>CraterTimings.bin </I>that includes all the craters and other features required for the 1842-2011 dataset is included in the <B>Crater coordinates </B>download available on the Downloads page on the Maintenance tab.

<h3>Output generated</h3>
The routine creates a file having the same name (and directory location) as the source file, but with the name augmented with:<br>
<B>_v0</B><br>
with the version number automatically incrementing to prevent overwriting.
<p>Reduction values are written in the fields of Height, ULat, and Percent, overwriting the existing values.
