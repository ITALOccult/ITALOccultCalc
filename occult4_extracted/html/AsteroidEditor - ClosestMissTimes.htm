<H1>Adjustment - Closest Miss times</H1>

<p>This lists the correction to be applied to Miss events to ensure that the time specified is the time of closest approach to the centre of the plotted ellipse. 

<p>Click the <B>Correct times in Report </B>button, and the times of all listed miss events will be 
corrected by the amount indicated.

<p>NOTE: The plot of the observations uses a dynamic reference frame defined by the data points plotted. As a result, any adjustment of Miss times can alter the origin of the reference frame - such that the applied correction is insufficient to align the Miss events with the fitted ellipse. Also, the fitted ellipse may shift with respect to the observed chords. In these situations, it will be necessary to repeat the <B>Adjustment of Miss times</B> several times, and possibly adjust the location of the fitted ellipse.
