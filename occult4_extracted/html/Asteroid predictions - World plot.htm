<H1>Asteroid/Planet occultation - Main prediction</H1>
<P>This form is the principal form for displaying an occultation prediction, and accessing more detailed predictions.</P>

<P align=center><img src="AsteroidDisplay%20WorldMap.png" width="600">
<h3>Moving between plots</h3>
<li>You can step forwards or backwards through the list of events displayed in 
List and Display simply by using the buttons with the '<strong>&#8678</strong>' and '<strong>&#8680</strong>', or the items under the menu item <B>Move to...</B>. And you can click Exit, or close the form, to cease moving through the file.<li>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<li>
<h3>Earth map</h3>
<li class="auto-style1">The map of the Earth is drawn from the direction of the star. The sunlit region is indicated by 
light-pink circles. The line corresponding to sunset (solar zenith distance of 
90° 50') is marked with a thick orange line. The three dashed orange lines 
correspond to Civil Twilight (-6°), Nautical Twilight (-12°) and Astronomical 
Twilight (-18°).<li class="auto-style1">The map of the Earth is oriented in accordance with the time of closest approach of the path to the nominated plot site - which is plotted as a blue '+'. The coordinates of this location are set just above the plot at the boxes for Site Longitude and latitude. When a map is first plotted, the site set in the Selection Criteria is inserted as the site location. You can reset the site location by double-clicking on a location, followed by the button with the '||'.</li>
<li class="auto-style1">&nbsp;<class="auto-style1"><B>Note</B>: plotting the map on the basis of the site location is very important for two issues
<ol class="auto-style2">
	<li>for slow-moving occultations, the path may extend well beyond a hemisphere; you need to select a plot site near the path to bring the path onto the 'visible' side of the Earth; 
	<li>Similarly, for slow-moving events the location of the terminator is dependent on the time used for the plot. So to get the correct positioning of the terminator 
and twilight zones, you need to select a plot site near the position along the path of interest.</ol>
<ol class="auto-style2" start="3">
	<li>For very slow events (lasting hours, or even over a day: if the duration 
	to cross the Earth is greater than 1 hour, the Map will be draw with the 
	longitude of the site on the central meridian of the world plot.</li>
	<li>For shorter events, the basis of the plot can be swapped using the radio 
	button 'Time Centered' in the menu bar at the top of the form.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li class="auto-style1">&nbsp;<class="auto-style1">The occultation path on the earth is plotted as two solid lines (the northern and southern limit), and two dotted lines (the location of the limits assuming a 1-sigma displacement of the occultation path. The path location takes into account the Earth's rotation. For slow events the path can appear quite distorted; it can also extend beyond the displayed hemisphere 
(indeed, can even extend more than 360deg in longitude), or (more rarely) only extend part way across a displayed hemisphere.  Time markers are given at 1 minute intervals (for plots greater than a scale of 1). 5 and 10 minute markers are of greater length.

<li class="auto-style1">&nbsp;<class="auto-style1">The occultation path 'in space' is also shown, terminating at the first  minute before/after the occultation. 
Where there appears to be a lateral displacement between the path on the Earth, and that 'in space', that is a plotting effect arising from the earth's rotation.

<li class="auto-style1">&nbsp;<class="auto-style1">The plot can be drawn at different scales, using the Plot scale buttons at the top left. The scales vary from 0.1 to 32 (but the Redraw menu item has an additional scale of 0.01). The button with || merely redraws at the same scale.
When the occultation path misses the earth, the scale of '1' is automatically 
adjusted on the basis of the minimum distance of the path from the center of the 
Earth.

<li class="auto-style1">&nbsp;<class="auto-style1">You can plot sites, and site names, using the drop-down boxes at top right 
	(after disabling the Export buttons from the Menu item Options... Export 
	buttons). The left box enables you to select a site file. The right box set the criteria for including site names on the plot (using the settings in the site file for each site.)<li><p>
	
<h3>Uncertainty ellipse, and star chart</h3>
	<li class="auto-style1">An uncertainty ellipse is plotted, showing the 1-sigma uncertainty ellipse. It can be re-positioned to the location of the cursor with a left click. [If the position is over the map, you will have to follow the left click by clicking the replot button with the '||'.] You can choose to not plot the ellipse, using the relevant menu item under
	<B>Options</B>....
	<li class="auto-style1">A small star chart (2 x 2 deg) is displayed. The occulted star is always in the exact center, surrounded by a grey circle. Where a star has a Bayer letter or Flamsteed number, that is included. The star chart shows the motion of the asteroid by way of a green dashed line. The end of each dash corresponds to 0hrs UT. The line has 5 dashes before the occultation, and one dash afterwards. The line is drawn such that there is no dash on the day of the occultation. You can choose to not plot the star chart, using the relevant menu item under
	<B>Options</B>....<li><h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<li>
<h3>Maps of satellite and ring orbits</h3>
<p>The presence of moons or rings will be noted at the top of the plot, with 
whatever information is available. </p>
<p>Where an asteroid has one or more satellites with 
sufficiently characterized orbits (radius and orientation), Occult can plot a 
representation of the satellite system Similarly when an asteroid has a ring 
system that is similarly characterized. The plot is only included if the menu 
item 'display asteroid's ring and moon systems' is selected. </p>
<p>The plots are oriented as a projection onto the Earth, and are compatible 
with the occultation path as plotted. [The directions N, E and W arev indicated 
on the plots.] However these plots are not drawn at the same scale as the earth 
- and the length of the sides of&nbsp; each plot is given at the bottom of each 
plot. These issues are illustrated in the following example, where the plot for 
the ring system has a side length of 5200km (a little less than the Earth's 
radius), while the plot for the moons has a side length of 114,000km - or about 
20 earth radii.&nbsp; The plots appear like:</p>
<p>If the asteroid has rings, the plot will include an extra set of path limit 
lines, corresponding to the nominal limit of where occultations by a ring may be 
visible. The uncertainty in the location of this limit can be treated as being 
the same as for the main body.</p>
<p>When the apparent orbit appears elliptic, the expected times of occultation 
by the rings are not symmetrical about the time for the main body. To assist in 
identifying the start and end times needed to cover the ring events as seen at a 
location, you can generate a list of predictions of reng event times for 
multiple locations, with the menu item&nbsp; <strong><em>With this event... 
Asteroid rings contact times for multiple locations</em></strong></p>
<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Issues when the star's diameter is significant</h3>
<p>When the star has a significant diameter, the circumstances of the occultation will be 
affected. The main effect is that the light curves will have a degree of being gradual. However it is possible for an occultation to be an 
annular event.</p>
<p>Where the effect of stellar diameter is significant, a light curve will be 
included in the prediction plot.</p>
<p>The usual path limits of the occultation are actually the limits of a partial 
occultation (equivalent to the penumbral limits for a solar eclipse). When the 
star diameter is significant, the plot will also include lines for the region 
where the occultation is a 'total' occultation, or an 'annular' occultation. 
These lines will similarly be included in GoogleEarth plots of the event.</p>
<p><P align=center class="auto-style1"><img src="AsteroidDisplay%20Umbra%20and%20lightCurve.png" width ="500"></p>
<p>In this plot, the Magenta dashed lines near the center of the path indicate the path where the occultation
is annular. The small light curve plot shows the expected light level during the occultation. The scale on 
the left side is brightness level, on a scale of 0 to 1. The scale on the right side gives the magnitude drop
(values of 1, 2 & 3 are shown.)</p>
<h3>Long-duration events</h3>
<p>If an event occurs near the stationary point in the asteroid's apparent 
motion, the path on the Earth's surface can become quite complex. It is 
possible for the path to extend around the earth multiple times. To ensure the 
path location is accurately predicted for these events, the occultation elements 
are computed using positions of the asteroid calculated at a time interval 
commensurate with the total event duration (4 positions at step intervals of 
2.5, 5, 10, or 20 hours[depending on the overall event duration], rather than 
the usual step of 1 hour).</p>
<p><P align=center class="auto-style1"><img src="AsteroidDisplay%20SlowEvents.png" width ="500"></p>

<h3>Header information</h3>
	<li class="auto-style1">The top line gives the asteroid/object, star identifier, date, and time 
	range during which the occultation occurs somewhere on the earth. When the 
	event extends over a day boundary, the date here is always set to the day on 
	which the event starts, with the end time being an hour greater that 24 
	hours. 
	<li class="auto-style1">At the left, details of the star. Magnitudes v 
	(Visual) and r (Red). Coordinates are J2000, epoch of date. If a correction is applied to the 
relative position of the asteroid/planet and star, the correction will appear as a change in the star's position.  Note that the precision of the displayed coordinates is generally less than the precision used when the occultation elements were generated.
	A reliability value is displayed. Usually it is the Gaia RUWE value. However 
	under certain circumstances a warning is displayed. One of those is for 
	stars where the position is from the 'old' HIP2 catalogue, with the 
	possibility that it is a low-precision duplicate of another star in the Gaia 
	catalogue<li class="auto-style1">Also at top left - the date on which the occultation elements were generated. [This allows people to assess whether the prediction is 'the latest'.]
	<li class="auto-style1">At top center there are details of certain circumstances, including 
	details of the moon phase and elongation. Where possible, the estimated 
	magnitude drop is given in visual. If the Red magnitude of an asteroid is 
	available (see next dot point) the estimated drop in Red is given. For both, 
	the equivalent % drop is given in 
	brackets). Also, 
	the parameters of the uncertainty ellipse are given - with the axis numbers 
	being the semi-axes of the ellipse. 
	<li class="auto-style1">At top right - details of the asteroid, including both the physical and apparent diameter, and the hourly rate of motion. 
	If the asteroid has 2-color parameters in the file HGsHG1G2.csv, both Visual 
	and Red magnitudes will be listed. Otherwise only the Visual magnitude. 
	If the asteroid is contained in the ISAM database of asteroid light curve inversion models, 
	<B>(in ISAM) </B>will appear after the label <B>Asteroid.</B><li class="auto-style1">
At&nbsp; bottom right, the basis of the prediction is given. The first component 
is usually the source of the asteroid position, the 2nd is the basis of the 
errors. Where the source of the asteroid position is from JPL horizons, the 
Orbit solution identifier in Horizons is included. The word
<span class="auto-style3"><strong>Ephemeris</strong></span> appears if the final 
solution is based on the Horizons ephemeris of the asteroid (rather than Occult 
generating positions from orbital elements). It indicates the prediction is of 
the highest level of accuracy.<li><h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<li>
<h3>Footer information</h3>
	<p>At the bottom left of the line that gives the following information<ul>
		<li>The version of Occult used to generate the plot</li>
		<li>the source and date of the orbital elements used for the asteroid</li>
		<li>the basis of the errors in the prediction. In particular, whether 
		they are 'measured' values, or assumed values</li>
		<li>if the objects orbit has not been integrated, that fact (applies 
		mainly to comets)</li>
		<li>the taxonomic class (other than a main belt asteroid) (click
		<a href="Asteroid%20Taxonomy.htm">here</a> for the classes displayed).</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Advisory messages</h3>
At the top right of the plot, immediately under the header, an advisory message can appear indicating one or more of the following:
	<li>The prediction has come from the LuckyStar or RIO programs<li>The 
	taxonomic class of the asteroid (The classes that can be displayed are 
	listed <a href="Asteroid%20Taxonomy.htm">here</a>)<li>The asteroid is listed 
as a Binary Asteroid candidate on the basis of analysis of Gaia FDR3 astrometry 
of asteroids. The data shown is the mean orbital separation in km (with 
uncertainty), the estimated diameter, and the estimated maximum duration. There 
are always 2 solutions shown. If the separation is greater than 400km, the 
distance is given as a '?'. For some these, the separations can be over 
20,000km. The potential distance in path widths can be determined by dividing 
the distance by the usual asteroid diameter as listed in the event header. <li>The asteroid is known to have one or more moons
	- with basic details about those moons<li>The star is listed in the Washington Double Star catalog, or indicated as double in other catalogues, or is in the AAVSO Index file of Variable stars.


<br>
	<h3>Optional control buttons</h3>
	<li>In the menu line there are 5 icons to click on to generate:<ul>
		<li>a plot in Google Earth 	<img src="google_earth.png">
<li>the path coordinates <img src="Paths.png">
<li>a star chart&nbsp;
		<img src="Stars3.png">
		<li>a list of pre-point stars <img src="POINT06.png">
<li>for planetary events, a plot of the planet's 
		configuration <img src="Planet.png">
</ul>
	<br><li>The boxes used to control the plotting of sites can be replaced with a set of 'Export buttons' using a setting in the User settings. These buttons allow you to move through a large file of occultation elements, and copy particular occultation elements to any of 7 files. By this means you can create subset files limited to events visible in a particular region. When you save the elements to a particular subset file, the button is disabled.<br>The subset files have the same path and file name as the occultation elements file - but have ".Export A" through to "G" appended after the extension.  The subset files can be read in the same manner as the original occultation element file.
