<H1>Visibility of an occultation by Saturn</H1>

<p>It is known from the occultation of SAO 187255 on 1989 July 3 that an occultation of a mag 5.8 star is readily visible as the star traverses the ring system.

<p>The following are the conclusions drawn from the reports of the 2006 Jan 25 occultation of 
a mag 7.9 star by Saturn - which was observed in Europe.

<H2>Summary of observability <br>Occultation of HIP 42705 by Saturn, 2006 Jan 25</h2>

<p><B>Visual</B>
<p>At 25cm aperture, the star was hard to see adjacent the planet. It could be 
detected in the Cassini gap and possibly seen traversing the ring system,
but visibility was marginal at best, and required fairly good seeing.

<p><B>Video</B>
<p>The star was easily seen against the planet and rings when filtered to the I-band.
All observers found the star easier to detect near the pole.
Faint detection of the star in the Cassini gap with 20cm aperture and stacked images.


<p><B>Conclusions</B>
<p>Visual observation of an occultation by a mag 7.9 star by Saturn is at best marginal
in a 20 to 25cm telescope. Under good conditions the star will be visible in the 
Cassini gap. Video observations in 2006 were much enhanced by using a deep red filter - but
very large telescope aperture was required to compensate for the lower light intensity.
For future events, careful consideration must be given to the spectral type of the star in
order to select a filter that provides optimum increase in contrast.

<p>Stars brighter than 7.0 should be reasonably visible at 20cm aperture.

<p>Stars brighter than 6.0 should be visible through moderate telescopes - although
presumably a large magnification will be required (and hence manually-driven telescopes
may have difficulties).
