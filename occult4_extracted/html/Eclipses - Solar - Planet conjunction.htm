<H1>Planet conjunctions at Eclipses</H1>
This form is used to find planets close to the Sun at a solar eclipse, or close to the Umbra for a lunar eclipse. The form is called from either the Solar eclipse main form, or the Lunar Eclipse form, under the menu item <B>Find close planetary conjunctions</B>.

<H2>Solar Eclipses</H2>
When called from the Solar Eclipse form, this finds eclipses where one or more of the major planets are within 1 degree of the Sun, or (more particularly) are either occulted by or transitting the sun at the time of the eclipse. The form looks like:<p>

<img src="Eclipse%20conjunctions.png">

<p>To identify relevant eclipses, specify the start and end year for the search. The up-down controls for specifying the year changes the year in increments of 100 years. The allowable year range is -13000 to +17000 - the range covered by the DE431 ephemeris. Then click <B>Find eclipses</B>. A progress bar will appear to indicate progress. The routine works by accessing the normal prediction capabilites; this results in the regular display of a world-map for an eclipse - being the first eclipse in a 10-year block as the program works through the date range. 
<p>For each event, the list will identify all planets within 1 degree of the sun, together with a flag for each planet that indicates the nature of the event. [Most events involve only one planet.] The flag has the following meanings:
<table columns=3 border=1>
<TR><TH NOWRAP>Flag</TH><TH>Meaning</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>{none}</TD><TD>Planet is within 1 degree of the sun. However it is not close enough to be occulted by, or to be transiting, the sun.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>{sun}</TD><TD>Planet is closer than 18 arc mins to the center of the sun. Depending on the separation and the radius of the sun at the time, the planet might be occulted by the sun.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>{smiley}</TD><TD>Planet is closer than 18 arc mins to the center of the sun. Depending on the separation and the radius of the sun at the time, the planet might be in transit over the sun.</TD></TR></table>
<p>The usual eclipse predictions can be generated by simply clicking on an event in the list. All the usual prediction options for that event are then available.

<h3>Future events</h3>
The next instance of the various events of interest are as follows<ul>
<li><B>Simultaneous solar eclipse and transit of Mercury  </B> : 6757 Jul 5
<li><B>Simultaneous solar eclipse and transit of Venus </B> : 15232 Apr 5
<li><B>Solar eclipse with a major planet occulted by the Sun </B> : 2105 May 14 (Mercury)
<li><B>Solar eclipse with a major planet within 1 degree of the Sun </B> : 2047 Jun 23 (Mars)
<li><B>Solar eclipse with TWO major planets within 1 degree of the Sun </B> : 2914 Jun 15 (Mars and Jupiter)</ul>

<H2>Lunar Eclipses</H2>
When called from the Lunar Eclipse form, this finds eclipses where one or more of the major planets are within 3 degrees of the umbral shadow axis, with an indication of whether an occultation of the planet by the moon is possible. The form looks like:<p>

<p>For each event, the list will identify all planets within 3 degrees of the axis of the umbral shadow (as seen from the geocenter), together with a flag that indicates whether a lunar occultation of the planet is possible. The displayed distances are referenced to the axis of the umbral shadow as seen from the Geocenter. The flag has the following meanings:
<table columns=3 border=1>
<TR><TH NOWRAP>Flag</TH><TH>Meaning</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>{none}</TD><TD>All listed planets are within 3 degrees of the umbral axis, but none are close enough to be occulted by the moon.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>{sun}</TD><TD>One or more of the planets listed are closer to the umbral axis than the umbral radius plus the lunar parallax (about 1.5 to 1.8 deg), such that the planet is located within the umbral shadow as seen from some parts of the earth. The planet can be identified by it being followed by a † {dagger} symbol.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>{smilie}</TD><TD>One or more of the planets can be occulted by the moon as seen from somewhere on the Earth - AND it is located within the umbral shadow as seen from some parts of the Earth. As a result, it is likely that a lunar occultation of that planet, with the planet being located in the umbral shadow, is possible from somewhere on the Earth. The planet can be identified by the separation being given in arc-minutes, and by it being followed by a ‡{double-dagger} symbol.</TD></TR>

<h3>Intersting events</h3>
<ul>
<li><B>Next occultation of a planet during an eclipse</B> : 2014 Oct 8 and 2022 Nov 8 (Uranus in both eclipses)
<li><B>Next instance of two planets within 3 deg of the eclipsed moon</B> : 2898 Apr 27 (Mars & Uranus)
<li><B>Instances two planets being occulted by an eclipsed moon</B>:
<br> -5813 Jun 15 (Saturn & Uranus) ,
<br> -2363 Dec 25 (Jupiter & Neptune),
<br> -232 Dec 14 (Uranus & Neptune) 
<br>111 Jan 13 (Uranus & Neptune), 
<br>1580 Jul 26 (Saturn & Uranus), 
<br>7162 Mar 20 (Jupiter & Uranus), 
<br>7756 Apr 25 (Jupiter & Uranus), 
<br>8451 Dec 19 (Jupiter & Neptune), 
<br>10969 Sep 12 (Jupiter & Uranus), 
<br>15850 Dec 25 (Jupiter & Uranus)
<br><br>A detailed calculation shows that the most recent double occultation event (1580), the D and R events for both planets would have been observed at locations midway between Japan and New Guinea (such as Guam) with all 4 events being located well inside the umbral shadow and occurring during, or almost during, totality. For the next double occultation event (7162 Mar 20) there is no location where both planets are seen to be occulted, whereas for the one after that both Jupiter and Uranus will be seen to be occulted during the eclipse at far southern latitudes (nominally, far South America, but the deltaT uncertainty is over 150 deg in longitude).
