<H1>AOTA: Tab 1. Read CSV file, Integration and Binning</H1>

<h2>Open a CSV file</h2>
Initiate from either the menu bar under:<ul>
File... open CSV file, </ul>
or from the first tab (File open, Integration & Binning) using:<ul>
Open a CSV file</ul>
Select the CSV file to read. The file must have the format used by Limovie or Tangra. 

<p>If the CSV file contains data for comparison stars, you will need to identify the star that is the occulted star. Limovie can measure the occulted star and 2 comparison stars, while Tangra can measure the occulted star and 3 comparison stars. Users typically specify the occulted star as the first star in both Limovie and Tangra. However the occulted star could be any of the other measured stars.

<p>When the CSV file contains data for 2 or more stars, the following form will appear to allow you to specify which star is the occulted star. Note that the options for <B>star 3 </B>and <B>star 4 </B> are only enabled when those stars are present in the csv file. Select the star that is the occulted star, and click OK.
<P><img src="AOTA_SelectStar.png"><P>

<p>The data read can be sourced from .csv files created by the following 
measurement tools.<p><br>
<B>Limovie</B>:  
<ul>
	<li>Foreground & background for the measured star, Foreground for up to two comparison stars, and the Limovie frame identification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PyOTE</strong>: 
<ul>
	<li>Foreground less the background for the measured star and up to 3 
	comparison stars, and the PyOTE frame identification</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>R-OTE</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>superseded by <strong>PyOTE</strong>, it is limited to one comparison 
	star.<br></li>
</ul>
<p><B>Tangra</B> <I>unbinned</I> measurements:<ul>
<li>Foreground less the background as well as the background for the first star, foreground less the background for up to three comparison stars, and the Tangra frame identification.</ul>
<B>Tangra</B> <I>Binned</I> measurements:<ul>
<li>data for the measured star and up to three comparison stars, and the Tangra frame ID.</ul>
<B>Scanalyzer</B> <I>  Essential: using the ...._Export.csv file</I><ul>
<li>data for the measured star, a pixel number, and the associated UTC. No comparison stars. Background set using 5 readings before and after the start/end of the light curve.</ul>
Scanalyzer is used when the process for recording an occultation is to use a stationary telescope, with the stars being recorded for a period of time as they drift across the field. Image measurement tool is Maxim-DL. Scanalyzer is used to measure the data generated by Maxim. The scanalyzer software and 
instructions is available at:
<a href="https://www.asteroidoccultation.com/observations/DriftScan/Index.htm">
Drift Scan</a>

<p><strong>Unistellar (Electronic):</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Star less background. No comparison stars</li>
</ul>

The CSV data as read is maintained in arrays, and remains unchanged by any processing.

<h2>Integrity check</h2>
Having loaded the data, AOTA automatically performs an integrity check of the data. Details are <a href="AOTA%20Integrity.htm">here</a>.


<h2>Integration, Binning, expected Mag drop</h2>
<ul><Li>This step occurs automatically whenever a CSV file is read.
<li>This step can be called at any stage during subsequent analysis - by going to the first tab and clicking the <b>Integration/Binning details</b> button. </ul>

When searching a light curve for an event, it can assist if the expected magnitude drop is set before any real analysis occurs. This is provided for in this form with the blue box <B>2. Expected Mag drop</B>. A default value of 1.0 is set.

Changes to the binning and normalisation occur without having to re-read the original data. However all subsequent processing steps will need to be re-done. <ul>
<li>For a signal from an integrating camera, this allows the first frame of an integration block to be specified, and for setting the number of frames in an integration block
<li>Can be used with a non-integrated signal, to bin the observed frames - again specifying start, plus number of frames to bin.</ul>	

<img src ="AOTA_Binning.png" width="700">
<p><ul><li>The plot displays the first section of the CSV file. The number of points displayed can be varied between 50 and 4000 using the 'Display xx data points' item at the bottom left of the form.
·<li>The set of data points that are used for the first binned data point is indicated with a yellow rectangle. There are two ways of setting the location of the rectangle:<ul>
<li>Set the left side using the cursor and a Left mouse click; set the width using the cursor and a Right mouse click; or
<li>Use the controls at the bottom of the form to set the <B>First frame</B>, and the <B>Number of frames</B>.</ul>
For no integration/no binning, use a rectangle aligned with a single frame (that is, the <B>Number of Frames</B> set to 1). For a signal from an integrating camera, match the rectangle to a set of data points corresponding to a single block of identical output frames. This will set the frame ID to the first frame used in the integration block.
<li>The plot has faint vertical lines repeating at the integration interval - so that the correct positioning of the integration can be assessed along the light curve. {When the integration interval is correctly set, significant changes in the height of the signal should correspond to the location of the vertical lines - with the signal being largely constant in-between.}
</ul>

<h2> Normalisation</h2>
Variable atmospheric transparency (such as light clouds) can have the effect of varying the light levels along the light curve. Such variations are usually present in all the stars in the field of view. Details on Normalisation are given <a href="AOTA%20Integration%20and%20binning.htm">here</a>.



<!-- 
This function works by transferring the data read from the CSV file into a new set of arrays, based on the start location and the number of entries to be combined/binned. The combining/binning is performed by averaging the measurement values of the combined/binned measurements.

<p>Also created is an array used for the cross-correlation calculation - the values being the difference between the respective star value and the mean value for the entire signal. -->
