<H1>Select the site for predictions</H1>
<p align=center><img src="SetSite.png">
<P>The primary way of selecting the site for predictions is by way of a site file. A site file is created using the <a href="Site%20Editor.htm">Site Editor</a> that is found under the Maintenance tab. When a site is added to a site file, you specify a number of parameters such as telescope aperture, and graze travel distance, which controls the output generated in lunar occultation predictions.</P>

<p>Some of the issues to keep in mind when creating a site file are:
<li>Multi-Site predictions for a star generate predictions for all sites in a site file.
<li>The observer scan listing for grazing occultations is generated on the basis of all sites in the site file.
<li>The regional map generated in the Predictions of Multiple Sites for Multiple objects is sized to include all the sites in the selected site file
<li>If the 'Filter search to sites in file' box is checked, the generation of occultation elements is constrained to stars that <I>might </I>be occulted within the area covered by the site file.
<li>for solar eclipses and asteroid occultations, you might want the site file to cover a large portion of the Earth (or even the entire Earth)</p>
<p>It is quite possible that the site you want to select is in more than one site file. You need to consider the above issues when choosing which 
site file to use.

<h3><br>Selecting/Setting the site file and site</h3>
<p>First, select the relevant site file. Once selected, the longitude and latitude range of the sites in that file are displayed below the site file name. [For the significance of this, see above.] Then select the site from the listing of sites within that file.<br><br>
Having selected a site file and site, you can set that combination as your 'home' site by clicking the 'Set home' button. Subsequently, if you have changed the site and/or site file, you can return the settings to your 'home' site by clicking the 'Use home' button. The 'Home' setting is retained between sessions.<br><br>
For maximum search efficiency, you can check the 'Filter search to sites in file' box.  When this is checked, the scan of the XZ catalogue to identify stars that <I>might </I>be occulted includes a filter to exclude many stars that cannot be occulted as seen from any location within the site file coverage.</p>

<h3><br>Using an arbitrary site</h3>
<p align=center><img src="SetSpecialSite.png">
<p>At time you might want to generate predictions for a site that is not in a site file. To do this, click the 'Use single' button. The site file selections will disappear, being replaced by boxes for entering a site longitude, latitude and 
altitude, a site name to be included on the prediction, and the telescope aperture. Other parameters are fixed in the program at the following values:<li>
Magnitude correction = 0;
<li>Graze travel distance = 50km
<li>Plot site on Occult maps = No
<li>Plot site in Google maps = No
<p>To return to select a site from a site file, click 'Use Site files'.

<h3><br>Adjusting the Magnitude Limit correction</h3>
<p>There are times when you might want to adjust the magnitude limit correction applied to the selected site. You can do this with the Menu item 'Mag Limit Adjustment', where a range of corrections (in magnitudes) are available for selection. Note - the selection is not retained between sessions.</p>
