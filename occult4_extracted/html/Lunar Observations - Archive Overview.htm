<H1>Lunar observations - Archive overview</H1>
The most important part of the processing of a lunar occultation observation is ensuring it is included in a reliable, publicly accessible, archive. Unless that occurs, the observation will probably get lost at some time in the future. [Indeed, the electronic version of grazing occultations collected by Royal Greenwhich Observatory got lost - and those observations could only be retrieved because they had been published on microfiche - which IOTA-ES OCR'd.)

<p>Lunar Occultation Observations will be archived in the Astronomical Data Centres. A special format has been developed for the purpose of archiving the observations.

<p>The process from observation to archive is as follows: 

<p><B>The observer</B><ul>
<li>Observer makes an observation.
<li>Observer completes an observation report using any one of a number of tools for creating the report - Occult, LOW [Lunar Occultation Workbench], or an Excel report form. [The report could be created in a simple text editor, but this is not preferred as it will have no built in data checks.]
<li>Observer emails the report to a local coordinator.</ul>
<p><B>The local coordinator</B><ul>
<li>Coordinator receives report, and reads it into Occult or LOW
<li>Coordinator reduces the observations, and checks for any obvious errors
<li>If there are obvious errors that can be corrected, coordinator will make the correction needed.
<li>If there are errors that require advice from the observer, the coordinator will email the observer seeking that advice.
<li>If the observations are OK, the coordinator will email the observer with a preliminary reduction of the observations, convert the observations into the Archive format, add them to a current file of archive observations, and sort that file by date.
<li>Periodically the coordinator will send their archive file to a global coordinator. Any observations received by the coordinator after that time will be added to a new archive file..</ul>
<p><B>The global coordinator</B><ul>
<li>the global coordinator will periodically receive the local archive files, add them to a master archive file, and sort that file by date.
<li>The master archive file will be made available via one or more of the IOTA web sites as updates occur.
<li>Annually, the archive of observations at the Astronomical Data Centres will be updated with an additional 12-months of observations. This will usually occur about 6 months after the end of a year - to make sure all observations for that year have been received. Before Archiving, the global coordinator will review the observations for obvious errors, and remove duplicate entries</ul>

<p>Peripheral to this process, the observations will be available for inclusion in prediction and analysis tools. For example, the data used in Occult for generating graze profiles will  be updated on a regular basis to include the most recent observations.

<p>An important feature of this process is independance from individuals, or on particular software solutions. In particular, the process relies on an ASCII data format for both the report format and the archive format - which makes the data universally available.
