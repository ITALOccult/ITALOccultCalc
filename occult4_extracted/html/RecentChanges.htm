<H1>Summary of changes made since version 4.1.0.0</H1>
Occult 4.1.3.1 is based on a number of incremental additions or changes, as well as numerous bug fixes.The following is a summary of notable changes introduced into Occult since version 4.1.0.0.
 

<H2>General changes</H2>
<li> Added 'Strong Signing' to provide better security against hackers
<li> Incorporated a new accurate ephemeris of Phoebe (Saturn IX), plus ephemerides for the Lagrangian satellites Helene (Saturn XII), Telesto (Saturn XIII) and Calypso (Saturn (XIV).
<li> Updated the orbits of Pluto's satellites Charon, Hydra and Nix, and added orbits for Kerberos and Styx.
<li> Added functionailty to access the latest JPL-DE ephemerides as they become available
<li> Star catalogues - UCAC4. Added a check of whether the installed copy of UCAC4 has been corrected for certain errors. 
<li> Implemented the IMCCE L1.2 theory of the Galilean satellites.


<H2>Asteroid predictions</H2>
<li> added functionality to display rings around asteroids
<li> Added Kepler2 target stars
<li> Added unctionality to convert TNO occultation predictions generated by the IMCCE & RIO group, to Occult format.

<H2>Asteroid observations/analysis</H2>
* Added AOTA - Asteroidal Occultation Time Analyser

<H2>Lunar predictions</H2>
<li> Added Kepler2 target stars
<li> For occultations of double stars, added  an estimate of the time difference between the primary and secondary star. 


<H2>Lunar observations</H2>
<li> Lunar occultation observations editor. Added a warning when the graze flag is set for the current entry and the previous entry - if the stars are different - to prevent inadvertant failure to clear the flag for a non-graze event.


<H2>Eclipses</H2>
<li> Lunar Eclipse predictions. Contact times generated using the Danjon method using the latest determination of the height of the notional eclipse-forming layer - 86.9km. Also the umbral shadow is  adjusted to allow for the oblateness of the Earth as seen from the declination of the Sun.
<li> Added code to reduce Lunar Crater Timings made during a lunar eclipse
<li> Solar eclipses, Lunar eclipses, transits. Revised the way that deltaT was handled with predictions. Incorporated display of uncertainty in the value of deltaT
<li> Solar eclipses. Revision of the plotting routines, to eliminate a range of plotting errors. Added a display of the elongations of the major planets at the time of the eclipse.
<li> Solar eclipses. Added functionality to identify eclipses where planets are occulted or transiting the sun at the time of the eclipse, or within one degree of the sun.
<li> Lunar eclipses. Added functionality to identify eclipses where planets are nearby, and potentially occulted by, the eclipsed moon.
<li> Transits. Improved the functionality for finding events in historical periods.

<H2>Ephemerides</H2>
<li> Added functionality to display rings around asteroids
