<H1>Site editor</H1>
<P>This form is used to create and edit site files.
<P>Site files play an important part in Occult. Apart from containing your own personal site which you use for your own predictions, they can contain details of a large number of sites for a 
variety of purposes. For example:<ul type=1>
<li>a site file could contain all the major cities in a large region or the world, which can then be displayed on Occult maps - 
e.g. for eclipse maps,
<li>a site file could contain all the towns and villages in the region near the observer, so that plots of local events (such as graze paths) will show all those towns;
<li>a site file could contain all the locations of all possible observers of an event enabling <ul type=i>
<li>predictions of asteroid occultation path distances, or 
<li>for grazing occultations, an observer scan showing who else is close to the graze path.</ul>
<li>a site file could contain many towns/cities in a large region, to generate a table of local predictions for all those sites, such as local eclipse/transit circumstances
<li>a site file could contain a list of all active observers in a region, so that a regional coordinator can computing occultation and grazing occultation predictions for some or all of those observers.</ul>
<p>The site file structure is the same for all purposes - so that a site file created for one purpose can be used for any other purpose. However, the site file can play different roles. In some parts, the site file is used as a source of site information that the user selects sites from. In other parts, the site file is 
effectively a 'control file' dictating the content and extent of data generated by occult. Thus, for some functions it is important to limit the site file to sites within a region (especially for computing grazing occultations for a region) whereas for other purposes the site file might desirably cover the whole world. For that reason, it is quite 
likely that you will develop site files where sites are included in more than one file.

<p>Occult includes a number of site files covering different regions of the world. Users should feel free to edit them to meet their owwn needs, and to create their own site files.

<h2>Opening and saving site files</h2>
<p align=center><img src="Site%20OpenSave.png"><br>

<p>In this area you open and save site files. The currently available site files are listed in 
the drop-down box. Select one, and click <B>Open </B>{note: the name of the site file will be in the <B>Save </B>button}. You can import (merge) a site file into the existing sites listed in the main list of sites by clicking <B>Import site file </B>- and the site name in the save button is not changed. <B>Save As</B> allows you to save the file under a new name.

<p>All site files are located in the directory Occult\Sites\, and have the 
extension '.dat'

<h2>Main list - functions</h2>
<p align=center><img src="Site%20mainList.png"><br>
<p>The main list is where you control the edit process. Buttons at the right allow you to sort the list by Name, Longitude or Latitude. Buttons underneath allow you to edit a site, add a new site, delete a site, or delete all sites. Double-clicking on a site results in the site being opened for editing.

<p>If you select the Edit Site or the Add new site buttons, the currently selected site will appear in the editing fields below, ready for editing. When completed, the Accept button will result in either the replacement of the existing site, or the addition of a new site.


<h2>Setting site details</h2>
<p align=center><img src="Site%20details.png"><br>

<p>In this section various details for the site are specified. The details are explained as follows:
<table columns=3 border=1>
<TR><TH NOWRAP>Item</TH><TH>Comments</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>Site Name</TD><TD>This is the 'full' site name, used in various text predictions. 32 characters are allowed. The number of free characters remaining is given at the end of the box.<br><B>
	IMPORTANT</b> The full site name can form the basis of file names. Accordingly you need to 
	avoid using characters that are forbidden in file names. A list is given above the box.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD nowrap>Site short name</TD><TD>When plotting site names on maps, it is preferable to use a short name to 
	avoid clutter. Here specify the 'short' site name to use on maps. 9 characters are allowed. The number of free characters remaining is given at the end of the box</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>East Longitude,<br>
Latitude</TD><TD>The site coordinates. They can be entered in dms, dm.m or d.dd 
	format. Within the file the data is stored in d.ddd format. Remember that east longitudes are +'ve. That is, people in north and south America have -'ve longitudes.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Altitude</TD><TD>Site altitude in meters - referenced to mean sea level (msl).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Time Zone</TD><TD>The time zone offset from UTC. Currently Occult does not use this value.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Telescope aperture</TD><TD>This is used in lunar occultation predictions, to calculate the visibility of stars in occultation. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Correction to limiting magnitude</TD><TD>This is a correction to the limiting magnitude calculated when assessing the visibility of an occultation. Generally set this value to zero, If you find that you can see fainter stars than have been predicted, then adjust this value.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Travel distance for lunar grazes</TD><TD>This figure is used to indicate how far the observer at that site might be prepared to travel to observe a graze that is not particularly bright or easy to see. Default value here is 100 km.<br>
The travel distances for grazes of bright stars (brighter than mag 6.5, and brighter than mag 4.5, are set in the User Setting, in the <B>Lunar Occultations - grazes </B>box..
<br>Note that the travel distance settings are based on a 'flat earth' calculation of distances which becomes unsatisfactory for very large distances. Also at large distances the visibility criteria can be quite different, such as daylight instead of nighttime, or bright limb instead of dark limb.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Include in Occult maps</TD><TD>This is used to control whether a site is to be included on the Occult maps. There are 4 options. The first is to not include it on any maps at any time. The other three options allow you to differentiate between sites depending on the scale of the map drawn to avoid clutter on the map.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Include in Google maps</TD><TD>The GoogleEarth and GoogleMap functionality allows you to plot sites on those maps. However, placing maps on the internet with people's homes flagged raises privacy concerns (and those concerns may vary between legal jurisdictions as well as individuals). This option allows you to control whether or not the site can be output to a GoogleMap. There are 3 options
<li>Never - the site will never be included on a Google map.
<li>using reduced precision - the site co-ordinates are rounded to the nearest 5 arc mins for plotting purposes so that the location plotted is 'near' the actual site, but not at the site.
<li>using full precision.
<p><B>It is suggested that sites corresponding to people's place of residence should only ever be set as 'Never', or 'reduced precision', and that a place of residence should not be included for plotting as full precision without the owner's express consent.
</B><p><B>Note</B>. In any location where plotting to GoogleEarth or GoogleMaps occurs, the default setting for plotting sites is - don't include any.  That is, a GoogleMap including sites can only be generated by clear intent.</TD></TR>
</table>
<p>Default values for several of these fields are set in the User Settings, in the <B>Site Files </B>box. The graze travel distances for bright stars are set in 
the User Settings in the <b>Lunar Occultations - grazes</b> box.
