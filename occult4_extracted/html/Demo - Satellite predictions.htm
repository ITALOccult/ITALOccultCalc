<H1>Demonstration of Satellite predictions</H1>

<H2>Eclipses and Transits with the Planet</h2>
<ul type=1>
<li>Select the <B>Satellite phenomena </B>tab, and click the <B>PLANETARY eclipses.... </B>button
<li>Select Jupiter.
<li>The year should be the current year. Set the month for the start and end dates to 10. Click compute. A list of events is generated. This list includes all events that occur.

<br><br><li>At the right hand side, your site longitude and latitude (as set in the User Settings) should be displayed. If not, change these to your latitude and longitude
<li>Check the adjacent check box. Click compute. 
<li>A list of events is generated. This list is limited to events where Jupiter is above the horizon and the 
Sun below the horizon, at that location.

<br><br><li>Select Saturn, and repeat the above. Note the extra satellite numbers.
<li>The current series of events occur between 2007 and 2011. The next period starts in 2022.

<br><br><li>Select Uranus, and set the year to 2007, and repeat the above. Note the extra satellite numbers. The current series of events ends in Jan 2010. The next series starts in Oct 2046

<br><br><li>Select Neptune, and set the year to 2043 - January to December.
</ul>

<h2><br>Mutual Occultations of satellites</h2>
<ul type=1>
<li>Select the <B>Satellite phenomena </B>tab, and click the <B>MUTUAL eclipses.... </B>button
<li>Select Jupiter
<li>The next series starts in 2009. Set the Start and End dates to 2009 June. Ensure the check box in <B>Limit to site location</B> is unchecked. Click Compute.
<li>Note the predictions generated. Note how the contact times are given in the box at the right as you change the selected event.
<li>Select the event that occurs on 2009 6 20  (IV) ecl (I). Note the graphic at the bottom. The grey region represents the penumbra of the shadow of Callisto, and the white inner circle is the umbra.
<li>Change the plot time span (at the right, just above the plot). Notice how the motion of the shadow is quite non-linear. [But remember that the shadow is plotted with respect to 
the location of the moon joined by dots, not the central location] Also change the plot scale and see how the plot varies.
<br><br><li> Check the box in <B>Limit to site location</B>, and click compute. Notice how the output is limited to events that occur when the planet is above the horizon and the 
Sun is below the horizon.

<br><br><li>You can do the same for Saturn. The next series starts in October 2008.

<br><br><li>You can do the same for Uranus. The current series ends in 2010.
</ul>

<h2>Positions of satellites</h2>
<ul type=1>
<li>Select the <B>Ephemerides</B> tab, and click the <B>Satellites....</B> button
<li>The form lists all the satellites that can be predicted, with the brighter satellites pre-checked. You control the predictions by checking the planet and the satellites of that planet. When first opened, the Jupiter is selected, together with Io, Europa, 
Ganymede and Callisto.
<li>At the bottom left, set the <B>Duration</B> to 1 day. Then click <B>Compute</B>, and view the prediction.
<br><br><li>Select the planet <B>Saturn</B>. Check <B>Iapetus</B>, and clear the remainder of satellites for Saturn
<li>Set the <B>interval </B>to 4 days, and the <B>duration </B>to 80 days, then click <B>Compute</B>. Notice the magnitude for Iapetus, which varies through its orbit.
</ul>

 <h2>Appearance of satellites</h2>
<ul type=1>
<li>Select the <B>Ephemerides </B>tab, and click the <B>Graphics of the planets and their moons</B> button.
<li>The form will open displaying <B>Jupiter</B> for the current date and time.
<li>Set the <B>plot duration </B>to 10 days and the <B>plot interval </B>to 0.04. Click <B>Draw</B>. Watch the motion of the moons. 
<li>While the animation is running, clear the <B>Include small moons</B> check box. Notice how 3 inner moons disappear (and the plot runs faster).
<li>Click the various <B>Label </B>options to see how the display changes.
<li>Change the <B>plot duration </B>to 300 and the <B>plot interval </B>to 1 day. Under the <B>Draw </B>button, check the <B>x10</B> box. Click <B>draw</B>, and watch the outer satellites. Move the <B>Slider </B>to change the plot scale. While the animation is running, clear the <B>Display orbits </B>check box and view the motion of the moons in the absence of the orbit display.
<br><br><li>You can view the satellites of the other planets in the same way.

<br><br><li>You can also view the appearance of the inner planets. Select <B>Venus</B>. Set the <B>plot period </B>to 600 days, and the <B>plot interval </B>to 2 days. Have both the <B>x10</B> and <B>x0.1 </B>boxes unchecked, and the <B>slider </B>in the middle. Click <B>Draw</B>, and watch the changing appearance of Venus.
