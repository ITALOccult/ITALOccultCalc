<H1>URAT1 catalogue</H1>
<P>The USNO Robatoic Astrometric Telescope catalogue URAT1is an observational catalogue that covers the sky from the north pole to about -15deg. The coverage is indiacted in the following plot.<p>

<p>The essential components of the catalogue are 575 zone files (z326 to z900), and an index file <I>u1index.unf</I>. Also available are a ReadMe file that explains the data format, and ASCII index file, and several other support files.

<p>The catalogue is obtainable as a download from Vizier  [address to be specified.]

<h3>Why use URAT1?</h3>
The imaging epoch of the URAT1 catalogue is around 2013 to 2014. The imaging epochs of the UCAC catalogues, and of PPMX, are all around 2000 - which means that proper motions for 15 years or more need to be applied to obtain a position for current epochs. The result of this is that the uncerytianty in those positions are dominated by the uncertainty in the proper motions. The URAT1 catalogue provides high precision astrometry much closer to current dates, with the uncertainty in the proper motions being of secondary significance for the next several years.

<h3>Limitations of URAT1</h3>
The URAT1 catalogue is an observational catalogue with the following characteristics:<ul type=a>
<li>skycoverage is limited to the northern sky and part only of the southern sky.
<li>star positions are referred to the mean imaging epoch; they have not had proper motions applied to take them back to the epoch of J2000. 
<li>bright stars are not included
<li>stellar parallaxes are not included
<li>stars associated with close double stars are likely to not be included
<li>there are a number of false entries - for example, of asteroids that have not been detected in the processing.</ul>


<h3>Installation</h3>
To implement the URAT1 catalogue, download all the zone files, and the <I>v1index.unf</I> file - and save them in a directory of your choice. Then select that directory for the URAT1 path in the User Settings.
