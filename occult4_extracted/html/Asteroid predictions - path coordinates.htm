<H1>Path coordinates</H1>


<P>This form generates the occultation path coordinates. </p>
<img src="Asteroid%20Predictions%20-%20Path.PNG"width="800" />
<p>At the top of the form there are 4 boxes of controls. There purposes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>First box</strong> This sets two parameters that apply to both 
	type of path generation:<br><ul><li><strong>Include when the Sun is Up</strong>. 
	Typically the path only needs to be generated for where the Sun is below the 
	horizon. Check this option to generate the entire path<br></li><li><strong>Display extra precision in Time.</strong> Purpose is related to 
	generating a post-diction point to add to an Observations record of an 
	event, to provide sufficient time precision when an asteroid is moving fast.</li></ul>
	<br>
	<li><strong>2nd box</strong>. This is used for <strong>general</strong> path listing. It 
	generates the path at a fixed elevation for its entire length. Normally that 
	elevation will be MSL (Mean Sea Level) - that is, a value of zero. A different elevation (in 
	meters) can be set. There is also provision for setting the step size in the 
	coordinate used to generate the location of the path. This applies to both 
	Longitude and Latitude increments. Where the coordinates are based on time 
	intervals, you cannot adjust the interval (it is set in seconds as 0.004 * 
	Coordinate step (in deg) / shadow motion. That shadow motion is typically 
	the the time to move about 160 km, but can be quite different, as it relates 
	to the actual motion of the shadow.<br> <br></li>
	<li><strong>3rd box.</strong> This is used to generate at <strong>topographic</strong> path - 
	that is, a path that has been corrected for local elevations in the terrain. 
	This option takes considerably longer to generate than for box 2. However 
	when plotted in GoogleEarth the location of the path on the actual surface 
	of the Earth is shown.<br><br>If the prediction has been generated within 
	Occult, without ensuring the elements used are for the time of the event, 
	this option will not be available - and a help button is provided with an 
	explanation of what to do.<br><br>This box includes an option to add 'fence lines'. 
	That is, lines of equal separation at the Asteroid, expressed in meters. 
	Such fence lines are used to position observers at greatly different 
	locations along the path, such that they are position is different distances 
	across the topographic path. Apart from selecting this option, you specify 
	the distance between the fence lines, and set the number of fence lines on either side of 
	the center line. The terms 'Left' and 'Right' relate to the orientation when 
	the observer is looking along the path in the direction of motion of the 
	asteroid shadow (that is, the direction of the path for increasing time).
	<br>
	<br></li>
	<li><strong>4th box</strong>. This is for plotting the path in <strong>GoogleEarth</strong>. The plot of the path can be limited to be within a 
	longitude and latitude range. The values within the 4 controls need to have 
	signs to indicate East/West &amp; North/South. The values specified in the boxes 
	must be such that the longitude in the <strong>W</strong> is west of that in 
	the <strong>E</strong> box, and the value in the <strong>N</strong> box is 
	north of the value in the <strong>S</strong> box. <br>Additionally, an 
	option is available to display on the Google Earth map the elevations used 
	to generate the path location for the center line and both limits.
	<span class="auto-style2">This option is only available if the longitude and 
	latitude ranges are no more than 5 degrees</span>. When comparing the 
	differences between the displayed elevations and those indicated in 
	GoogleEarth, remember that the dataset used for the elevation corrections 
	has a resolution of about 1 mile square, such that significant variations in 
	elevation as shown in Google Earth are averaged out in the data used to 
	correct the path location.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<h3>Display of path coordinates</h3>
<p>An occultation path can be located anywhere on the Earth and oriented in any direction. This creates some difficulties in tabulating the path in latitude/longitude coordinates. The format can be of three different forms and can change between the two of these. The preferred format is uniform increments in longitude. The second preferred format is uniform increments in latitude - and when this occurs, the output often changes to a longitude increment part-way through. The least preferred (and least common) format  presents the path in uniform increments of time. 
The user has no control over which of these formats is displayed. <P>
An example of the format for uniform increments in latitude, longitude, and how the change between the two occurs is:

</pre>
<p>In this format the coordinates of the path limits and error limits given to the right include both longitude and latitude values.

<p>Most columns are self-explanatory. <ul>
<li>The 'Error Limit' is the location of the north or south limit if the occultation path is displaced by the 1-sigma value. 
<li>The last column gives a factor for deriving the correction lateral to the occultation path, for a change in observer's altitude. 
<em>This is not provided with topographic paths, as the path is already adjusted.</em> To 
adjust the path, multiply the altitude by this factor to get the displacement of the path. The sign associated with this correction can be confusing/misleading. 
The guiding rule is: if the occultation path is located between the observer and the center of the world plot, increasing the observer's altitude will place them further from the path. If the observer is located 
between the path and the center of the world plot, an increase in the observer's altitude will place them closer to the path. 
Putting this another way - an increase in the altitude at the path location will 
move the path sideways such that the path passes closer to the center of the 
Earth.</ul>

<p>At the end of the coordinates there are two lines like
<pre>Uncertainty in time = +/- 6 secs

[Prediction of 2007 Sep 25.2]</pre><ul>

<li>The first line gives the time uncertainty corresponding to the major axis of the error ellipse (which is usually aligned with the direction of motion]
<li>the second line gives the date the occultation elements were generated - and can be used to determine which of several predictions is the most recent.</ul>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Topographic paths - things to be aware of</h2>
<h4>Computation time</h4>
<p>The calculation of the path coordinates takes considerably longer than a 
'normal' path generation. This is because the path is stepped through by 0.7 arc 
mins (for stepping by either longitude or latitude) or for fractions of a second 
for stepping through by time. When fences are included, each fence takes about 
the same time as each path line - of which there are 5 for a prediction without 
fences. That is, the more fences, the longer the time.<p>The box that lists the 
display appears as follows:<ul>
	<li>during the actual calculation of the path, the box will be empty apart 
	from a message at the top about the calculation occurring.</li>
	<li>When the calculations are complete, the box will clear. It will then 
	take a little time (many seconds, increasing if you include fences) to populate the box.</li>
	<li>Thereafter the box will show the path coordinates. However it will not 
	display the fence coordinates. They are used solely for plotting the path in 
	GoogleEarth.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Low altitudes - stepping by time. 
</h4>
<p>The generation of a path corrected for local topography has some challenges 
when the star altitude is low. 
<p>One issue with that for low altitudes in mountainous terrain, the star may be 
hidden if you are 'behind' the mountain. This situation is not dealt with as 
such - with the path being plotted on the basis of the mountain being 
'transparent'.<p>When Occult steps through the path using Time (but not 
Longitude or Latitude), a small change in time can result in a long change in 
the location of the path on the Earth's surface. This can lead to the heights 
for successive approximations for the site location, to vary wildly in hilly 
terrain. Occult minimises this problem by placing limits on the allowable 
displacement at each step in an iteration, but even this is inadequate at very 
low altitudes. When this situation arises, the path will not have the appearance 
of a smooth line following the topography. Rather it can become very wavy, and 
indeed loop back on itself. Obviously such paths are unreliable. In relatively 
even terrain, this issue will not generally occur. But in mountainous regions 
(e.g. crossing the Andes) the issue can occur with star altitudes as high as 10 
deg.&nbsp; If Occult steps through the path using either Longitude or Latitude, 
this issue does not arise, as the longitude or latitude in the along-path 
direction is fixed in the iteration. That is, there can be no large 
displacements during the iteration, in the along-path direction, such that the 
heights in successive iterations are for similar locations.<p>&nbsp;<h4>Source of 
topographic data</h4>
<p>The function uses a file of surface elevations that 
cover the whole Earth. The source of the file is
<a href="https://ddfe.curtin.edu.au/models/Earth2014/readme_earth2014.dat">here</a>. 
The data is provided in rectangles of 1-arc min in latitude/longitude, with the 
altitude for that rectangle being some sort of average value over that region. 
Occult generates a height for any specific location using&nbsp; interpolation 
over adjoining rectangles. However in very rugged terrain the elevation 
so derived may be significantly in error.<p>&nbsp;<h2>Information when plotted in 
GoogleEarth</h2>
<p>The path can be plotted in GoogleEarth, irrespective of whether or not it is 
a topographic path. The following details use a topographic plot to illustrate 
the full capability. If a fixed-elevation path is computed, there will be no 
fence lines, and the path location will not vary with the terrain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The path plot</h4>
<img src="Asteroid%20Predictions%20-%20Path.PNG"width="800" />

<p><img src="Asteroid%20Predictions%20-%20TopoPath.PNG"width="500">
<p>The lines have the following meanings:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Green</strong>&nbsp; the center path line</li>
	<li><strong>Blue</strong> the path limits (based on an assumed diameter, and 
	the asteroid being spherical)</li>
	<li><strong>Red</strong> the 1-sigma path uncertainty limits</li>
	<li><strong>Yellow</strong> the fence lines (if specified)</li>
</ul>
<p>When a fence line is within 2% of the asteroid's radius from a path limit 
line or 1-sigma limit line, that fence line is not computed or displayed.</p>
<h4>The GoogleEarth legend</h4>
<p><img src="Asteroid%20Predictions%20-%20TopoPathLegend.PNG"width="400" />
<p>The legend is displayed in the left panel of GoogleEarth, under Temporary 
Places. </p>
<p>The first line gives the file name used to plot the path. This file will be 
found in the Occult folder /<strong>Generated Files/GoogleEarth</strong>. The file name is 
structured as:</p>
<p class="auto-style1">Star + Asteroid + date + MSL/topographic. The last word 
is 'elevations', followed by a single letter in the range of <strong>a </strong>
to <strong>k</strong>, to allow multiple map files for the same event. The 
allocation of <strong>a</strong> to <strong>k</strong> is done automatically.
<strong>You need to periodically review this folder, and delete files that are 
no longer needed.</strong></p>
<p>There are then a set of identification labels for each line. Fence lines 
include the distance from the center line, in meters. This is the distance at 
the asteroid, not a distance on the Earth's surface. The labels left and right 
relate to the direction offset from the center line as if you were located on 
the center line looking in the direction where the occultation shadow is moving. 
That is, in the direction of increasing event time. Clicking the small check box 
against each label will turn the display of the line on or off.</p>
<p>The last group, in the folder <strong>UTCtimes</strong>, relate to the next 
image...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Time and other info along the path</h4>
<p><img src="Asteroid%20Predictions%20-%20TopoPathTime.PNG"width="200">
&nbsp;<p>Along the center line you will see small target markers. These are 
located approximately every 10 seconds along the path. Click on that marker, and 
you get a box which displays:<ul>
	<li>Predicted UTC of the event at that location. [The precise time at that 
	location may differ from the listed time by several 10ths of a second. Much 
	greater if the path is an MSL path] </li>
	<li>Whether the path is at MSL, or is a topographic path</li>
	<li>If it is a topographic path, the site elevation that has been used to 
	generate the topographic path position (with the source of the elevation 
	data being listed). The site elevation here will almost always differ from 
	the Google Earth elevation for that location, by perhaps a few 10's of 
	meters.</li>
	<li>the altitude and azimuth of the star</li>
	<li>the altitude of the Sun </li>
	<li>the orbit used, and the date of the prediction</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<h4>Old map formats</h4>
<p>In the most unlikely event certain old mapping environments are still being 
used, Occult has retained the capability of writing files compatible with them. 
While they have been retained in Occult, there is no guarantee that they will 
still create useable files. The options are available&nbsp; under with <B>Prediction,... Save in map formats</B>. This means you can display the path on your mapping device as you drive to your location. Formats supported are:<ul>
<li><B>.cmx </B> - <A href ="http://www.chicagomap.com/" target=_blank>Precision mapping streets</a>, covering USA and Canada. Note: if emailing these files, you must ZIP them to avoid corruption.
<li><B>.gen</B> - for making ESRI shape files. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target=_blank>Explanation of ESRI shape files</a>.
<li><B>.gpx</B> - Easy GPS. EasyGPS can interface with Garmin, Magellan, or Lowrance GPS units. It is available as freeware from <a href="http://www.easygps.com/" target=_blank>here</a>.
