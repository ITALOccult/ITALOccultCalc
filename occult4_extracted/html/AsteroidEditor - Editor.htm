<H1 class="auto-style1">Asteroid observations editor</H1>
<P class="auto-style1">This form is used to enter and edit observations of asteroid occultations.

<p class="auto-style1">The form as three logical components:
<li class="auto-style1">Fields which are specific to an event - namely, the date, star and asteroid
<li class="auto-style1">Fields which are specific to an observer - namely the observer details, times, and conditions
<li class="auto-style1">Fields for managing the data, including the display of historical events.

<h2>Fields specific to an event</h2>
<p>These fields, which are in groups with an orange background, need to be completed when a record is created for a new event.
<h3>The event date</h3>
<P align=center><img src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20date.png">
<p>Set here the Date of the event, and the approximate mid-time of the observations.,
<p>The mid-time is used to generate a 3rd-order expression for the motion of the asteroid's shadow past the Earth. The 
time is set to 0.1 hrs - and should be for a time close to the middle of all the 
observations. A time of 0.0 hours is not allowed - use 0.1 instead.<p><B>Note 1</B>: If observations extend across a day boundary, ensure the date corresponds to the day of the earliest observation and that all times for the following day use hours 24 and greater.
<p><B>Note 2</B>: If the mid-time field is changed, you should click the button <B>Get details </B>in the <B>Asteroid</B> box to make sure that the internal expression for the asteroid's motion is updated. If the dates is changed by more than a few 
hours, you should also click the button <B>Get details </B>in the <B>Star</B> box to make sure the star position is correct.


<h3><br>The star number</h3>
<P align=center><img src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20star.png"width="150">
<P align=center><img src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20star2.png"width="150">
<p>To specify the star, you must first select the catalogue from the drop-down box. The catalogues catered for are Hipparcos, Tycho2, 
UCAC4, UCAC3, UCAC2, USNO-B1, NOMAD, URAT1, and Gaia stars in the Occult Gaia 
catalogues that have not been matched to UCAC4, Tycho2 or Hipparcos - identified 
by Ghhmmss.s±ddmmss. Use the catalogue first in this order. 
Provided the Gaia catalogue is installed, Occult will endeavor to retrieve a 
Gaia position for the star - and will preferentially use Hipparcos, Tycho2 and 
UCAC4 star identifiers. If a Gaia position has been retrieved, that fact will 
appear at the bottom-right of this group.<p>The data fields for the star number depend on the star catalogue. Hipparcos, UCAC2, 
and the Gaia coordinate identifier, have a single field; Tycho2  has three fields (region, number, and component), while 
the remainder have two fields (zone and number)
<p>When the number has been entered, click the <B>Get details </B>button to retrieve the star coordinates. [If star coordinates are not retrieved, you cannot plot the observations.] Also displayed on a separate form will be all double star entries in the Washington Double Star Catalogue and 4th Interferometric Cataogue. [For this to be functional, these catalogues will need to be downloaded from the Downloads option on the Maintenance tab.]
<p>In appropriate circumstances, an extra button, and 2 extra data items are 
displayed.<p>The <strong>Identify G*</strong> button checks whether a star 
identified by the G coordinates has a traditional identifier in the Occult Gaia 
catalogue. If so, this identifier should be used.<p>If the star position in the 
Occult Gaia catalogue has used the UCAC4 position to derive a proper motion, 
this fact is noted. The fact thta this has occurred is an indicator that there 
are problems with the position of this star<p>If the star has an apparent 
diameter that could lead to events being gradual, the estimated duration of such 
fades, as seen on the center line, is given.<p><B>Note 1</B>: to retrieve USNO-B1 stars, you need to have the NOMAD catalogue. To retrieve a 2UCAC star that is fainter than mag 12, you will need to have either the full 2UCAC catalogue, or the NOMAD catalogue.
<p><B>Note 2</B>: Manual entry of star coordinates is not available in this version of Occult - a deliberate decision to avoid erroneous data entry.

<p><strong>Note 3</strong>: The Gaia number by coordinates matches stars by the 
firsts star that is within 0.1sec of the RA and 1&quot; of the Dec - with the 
coordinates being specified for the version of Gaia (almost inevitably DR2 - 
2015.5) When there are two stars close together, the possibility of the wrong 
star being identified in the first instance is real. For example, an occultation 
on 2019 Jan 2 by Alven occulted a star identified as G100729.6+131605. The 
star's coordinates (2015.5) are:<p>10 07 29.5956&nbsp; +13 16 05.09<p>However 
the previous entry in the file is:<p>10 07 29.4260&nbsp; + 13 16 06.44<p>The 
specified G coordinates retrieves the previous entry star, as it is the first 
star to match the coordinates at the 0.1s/1&quot; precision. The correct 
star is retrieved by adjusting the identifier to G100729.7+131605.
<span class="auto-style8">The point to remember here is to ensure you have 
retrieved the correct star by comparing the retrieved coordinates with those in 
the prediction, and adjusting the identifier as required to retrieve the correct 
star.</span><h3><br>The asteroid or planet</h3>
<P align=center><img src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20asteroid.png"width="200">
<P align=center><img src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20asteroid2.png"width="200">
<p><B>To specify an asteroid</B>
<li class="auto-style1">select the Asteroids radio button
<li class="auto-style1">enter the asteroid's number. <li class="auto-style1">click <B>Get details</B>. The field for the Name will be completed, as well as the information items of 
the shadow's motion on the fundamental plane (in km/sec), the parallax, visual 
magnitude, and diameter in km. If the asteroid is in either the DAMIT or ISAM 
databases of shape models, the number of models available in the relevant 
database will be given in yellow text on a blue background. The blue background 
can be clicked to download the shape models.

<p>Instead of the asteroid's number, you can enter the name - but it has to be 
the full name (case insensitive). Usually you should enter the number.<p>For unnumbered asteroids, you need to enter its name - making sure that it is identical to the MPC formatted name. 
<p><B>Note</B>. If you are entering an observation of a relatively small asteroid, you will need to make sure the asteroid is in the file of asteroid elements maintained by Occult. For this purpose, it is usually best to include the asteroid number in the list of 'mandatory' minor planets maintained on the form for <A href="Maintenance%20Convert%20Astorb.htm"> Converting Astorb etc.</a> 
<p><B>Note 2</B>. When an asteroid is not included in the current file of asteroid elements, you can update that file from the Main Occult form from either the Asteroid Predictions tab, or the Maintenance tab, by clicking the <B>Convert ASTORB and MPCOrb </B>button, without closing the editor. Once the asteroid has been added and a new file created, you can go back to the editor and click the <B>Get Details </B>button to retrieve the asteroid details.

<h4>To specify a planet or satellite</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Check the radio button Planets</li>
	<li>select the planet and satellite using the drop-down boxes</li>
	<li>click <B>Get details</B>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The information displayed 
at the bottom of the box is</p>
<ul>
	<li>the motion of the shadow on the fundamental plane, in km/sec</li>
	<li>the parallax of the object, and its hourly rate of change</li>
	<li>the visual magnitude of the object</li>
	<li>the objects diameter and uncertainty in km; its apparent diameter in 
	mas. If the asteroid's diameter has been derived from its absolute 
	magnitude, the diameter is indicated as an estimated diameter (est.Dia.....)</li>
</ul>

<h2><br>Fields which are specific to an observer </h2>
<p>These fields are in groups with a light green background, and specify details of an observation. Each observation consists of a Disappearance and 
Reappearance event pair. In the case of a double star or double asteroid, there needs to be an observation line for each component.
<h3><br>Observer details</h3>
<P align=center><img src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20observer.png">

<p><B>Observer name</B> The form provides for two observer names to be expressly 
specified, with a box to check if there are more than two observers. [When there 
are 3 or more observers, only 2 names can be specifically stated.]<p>The 
observer names are used when reporting astrometry to the Minor Planet Center. To 
avoid any problems when reporting the astrometry, it is critical that the name 
fields are filled on as follows:<p>&nbsp;To facilitate extraction of name information for reporting results to (for example) the 
Minor Planet Center (MPC), the following formatting is essential:<ul>
	<li>Names are given as an Initial, followed by the family name - e.g. 'D Herald'</li>
	<li>One or more full given names can be specified. However it will be 
	automatically reduced to a single initial when reporting to the MPC.</li>
	<li>Name qualifiers like Mc (as in McArthur), Van der...., and so forth, 
	should be included.</li>
	<li>Qualifiers like Mrs/Mr etc must not be included. Similarly educational 
	qualifications (eg PhD), or membership of organisations, must not be 
	included.</li>
	<li>Do not qualify the name with anything intended to indicate the 
	observer's location. The field must contain the observer's name, and 
	absolutely nothing else!</li>
	<li>There MUST be an initial. A family name with no initial will not be 
	accepted by the MPC</li>
	<li>The name must be of a person, not an organisation.</li>
	<li>The field is processed in the order of given name - family name. For 
	cultures where the family name normally comes first, it is important that 
	the names be captured in the given name - family name order.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Located near</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style1">This box provides for a textual description of the 
approximate location of he observer. It is provided essentially for assistance 
with validation the site coordinates, in instances where there is cause for 
concern about where the observer was located. As a free text box, users should 
try to make sure that what is specified has meaning to 3rd parties, potentially 
years after an event. In circumstances where an observer sets up a multi-station 
deployment with all having the same approximate location, it is appropriate to 
label the sites by appending characters like '#1'&nbsp;&nbsp; '#2' etc </p>
<p><strong>Country or State</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>This field provides for an indication of the country or state in which 
	the observer was located - again, solely for general indication of where the 
	observer was located. The filed is to be completed by specifying the 
	relevant International Standard 2- or 3- letter country codes or (for 
	Australia, Canada, and the USA) state or province codes. 
	<li>for a list of the codes, click the Help button just above this box.<li>
	Commas cannot (&amp; must not) be used in this field</ul>

<p><B>Telescope aperture</B> - specify to the nearest cm. 
<p><B>Telescope type</B> - select the most appropriate from the drop-down box. 
Available options are</p>

<ul>
	_ = unstated<br>1 = 
								Refractor<br>2 = Newtonian<br>3 = SCT<br>4 = Dobsonian<br>5 = Binoculars<br>6 = Other<br>7 = None<br>8 =	Electronic
</ul>
<p>When Electronic is selected, the Method, and Time fields are automatically set for that telescope type/p>


								<p><B>Site coordinates</B> - select the relevant format for the data entry (dms, dm.m or d.dd), then enter the coordinates. Remember to include a '-' for west longitudes (i.e. the Americas, most of England, etc.] and for southern latitudes.<ul>
<B>Note</B>. Once an observation line has been entered, you can plot all observation sites in 
GoogleEarth under the menu item <B>with Observations... Plot sites in GoogleEarth</B>. This will highlight any significant data entry error!</ul> 

<p><B>Datum</B>. Indicate the datum used for the latitude/longitude, using the drop-down box. 
Almost all modern datums can be treated asWGS84<p><B>Altitude</B>. Select meters or feet (the data is stored as meters). <B>Note</B>. Altitudes are assumed to be referenced to mean sea level (msl) 
- which is the international standard for referencing altitudes. Some GPS units 
have the ability to output an elevation referenced to the WGS spheroid. That 
elevation <strong><em>MUST NOT BE SPECIFIED</em></strong> - always use altitude 
above mean sea level (msl).
<p>The word Altitude is actually a 'button'. Click on the word <strong>Altitude</strong>,&nbsp; and you will activate the
<strong>Site Altitude</strong> validation function that is described below under the <strong>with Observations...</strong> description. 
When an event is read from a file, or is pasted, the word Altitude will be shown 
in red - until the site validation has been undertaken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<H3><br>Event times</h3>
<P align=center><img src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20Times.png" width="240">
<p>Enter the <B>observed times </B>of the events here. Particular issues are:<ul>
<li>Ensure each field of h, m and s is completed. If any of the fields for a time is blank, the event will be treated as a 'no event'.
<li>For a Miss event, insert the expected time of the occultation - for BOTH the D and R
<li>'<B>+/-</B>' is the 3-sigma uncertainty in the reported time. For a visual observation, it is usually smaller than the PEq.
<li><B>PEq </B>is the personal equation applied to visual observations. Preferably, the reported time should be corrected for PEq. In any case, the value should be specified here.
	<li><B>Wt</B>. A value of 0 to 5. This field should normally be left blank - in which case visual observations are weighted as 1 and video observations are weighted as 
	5. 
However during analyses stages it may be appropriate to apply different 
weightings (within the range 0 to 5). A weighting of 0 results in an observation being excluded from the solution but 
	can be included in the plot of observations (with the observation number being underlined). 
	The default values (which are used when the setting is blank) are set as 
	follows:<br>&nbsp; 5 - for analogue or digital (non-SLR) video<br>&nbsp; 4 - 
	for digital SLR-camera video, and Photometer<br>&nbsp; 3 - for sequential 
	images and drift scan<br>&nbsp; 1 - for visual and anything else.<br>&nbsp; 
	0 - event is ignored in any solution, but can still be plotted, depending on 
	obne of the options on the Plot form.<li><B>Time Shift (secs</B>) This is an adjustment applied in analysis to bring a discordant observation into alignment with other observations. It assumes the 
existence of an error in the time base used by the observer. A time shift should 
not be applied without good reason.
	<li><B>Not seen</B>. <span class="auto-style18">This should rarely be used</span><span class="auto-style17">. 
	</span>This allows a coordinator to enter the coordinates of an observer to demonstrate what they missed out on as a result of (for example) cloud, or failing to go out and observe. Data entries for this event type are not added to the file of 
	<B>Historical observations.</B></ul>

<p>You also need to indicate the <B>Event qualifier </B>using the check boxes. Check boxes in the left column can be checked by themselves, or (when appropriate) together with check boxes in the right column. The significance of the check items is:<ul>
<li>a 'normal' occultation with regular D and R events has no check boxes 
marked.<li><B>No occultation detected</B>. Check this to indicate no occultation was detected. A nominal D and R time (hh mm ss) must be specified for both (a time consistent with the event analysis will be generated during the event analysis). These events most commonly identify observations where the asteroid does not cover the target star (a so-called Miss event). However there may be other explanations for such an observation.
<li><B>Prediction</B>. It is very useful to include an entry representing the prediction, as a means for verifying the data entry and accuracy of the observation. 
The preferred source of the prediction entry is from an Occult generated path 
prediction using the Horizons system with the paste from that prediction 
including the JPL solution number and date.<li><strong>unseen Satellite parent</strong>. This is used when the 
	observations for an event are of the satellite of an asteroid, and not the 
	main body of the asteroid. Such an event is <span class="auto-style16"><em>2010 June 14 
	(617) Patroclus</em></span>. To process such an observation, Occult needs a 
	nominal 'observation' of the main body. While the box can be checked 
	manually, the strongly preferred approach to such a situation is:<ul>
		<li>generate a prediction for the asteroid (which will usually relate to 
		the main body)<li>generate path coordinates for that event, and select a 
		line near the location of the observation - and click the menu item 
		<strong>with prediction... Copy prediction line for Observations report... 
		Occult</strong>.<li>In the observations editor, click the menu item 
		<strong>Paste... 
		Prediction for the primary body of a binary asteroid (which has not been 
		observed</strong></ul>
	<p class="auto-style15">This will create two lines in the observation editor. One is a Prediction line, 
with event code<strong> P</strong>. The other is an event line for the unseen primary, with event 
codes <strong>e </strong>and<strong> f </strong>and an observer name of <strong>Unseen-Primary-Event</strong>.
	<p class="auto-style15">If you have a prediction line for the satellite, you can also paste that into the editor in the usual manner.</p>
<li><B>2nd star</B>. Where the occultation involves a binary star, this is used to indicate that the reported times are associated with the fainter star. Note:<ul>
<li>frequently the 'double star' event will only be noticed at one of the D and R phases. In that situation it would be 
expected that the report line for the 2nd star will contain just one time.
<li>It is often difficult to correctly associate the event times with each of the components. Frequently it is only at the analysis stage that the correct allocation of times to components can be determined.</ul>
<li><B>Ring</B> - an occultation by a ring around an asteroid or planet. D and R 
times are for the middle of the events on opposite arms of the ring. The 
duration of the occultation by a ring arm should be noted in the Free text.<li><B>Satellite</B>. 
	This box is checked when an occultation is by a satellite of an asteroid. 
	This may not be known until the analysis of other observations of that event 
	have been included.</ul>
IMPORTANT: Where multiple events are observed from the same location, 
place them in chronological order, to facilitate plots that show the star when visible.

<h2>Manage observers</h2>
<P align=center><img src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20ManageObservers.png">
<p>At the bottom-right of the form are buttons for managing the data contained 
in memory for the particular event displayed:<ul>
<li>Add the data in the edit fields as a new observation record<li>Replace the currently selected observation record with the data in the edit fields
<li>move the currently selected observation either up or down in the list of observations<li>
	delete the currently selected observation; and<li>sequentially renumber the observations in the list<br>
</ul>

<p>In addition,
controls are provided in the menu item <B>with Observations</B>, where you can sort the list of observations by any of<ul>
<li>longitude
<li>latitude
<li>the observer name field
<li>the observer name field ignoring the first two characters (that is, the family name of the observer - if the name has been entered in accordance with the guidelines above)
<li>path distance, or
<li>sequence number.</ul>
<B>Note</B>. Sorting by distance (followed by a Re-number) is particularly useful, as it ensures the observer numbers displayed on the plot of the event progress uniformly across the plot. This makes it much easier to find the chord of a particular observer.<br>

<h2 class="auto-style1">Displayed information</h2>
<p class="auto-style1">The following information is displayed in the bottom part of the form<ul class="auto-style3">
<li>A list box listing all the observations entered for the event<li>At the top left of the list box, the expected magnitude drop at occultation
<li>At top-middle of the list box - a summary of the current solution for the ellipse and any double star component
<li>At the top right of the list box (for observations in the Historical file) - if an astrometric position has been reported to the Minor Planet Center, the Minor Planet Circular number and publication date (yyyymmdd)  of the circular containing the relevant observer summary.</ul>

<h2 class="auto-style1">Analysing/fitting an ellipse to the observations<br>Setting the quality of the observation</h2>
<p class="auto-style1">The fitting of an ellipse to the observations, and other data analysis is done on a separate form. The form is accessed by clicking the menu item 
<strong>Plot event.</strong> If the form is already open, merely bringing that form into focus will generate a plot.
<p class="auto-style1">The details about fitting an ellipse, and setting the quality of the fit, are given <A href="AsteroidEditor%20-%20Plot%20observations.htm">here</a>
<p class="auto-style1">This form needs to be accessed and updated before saving an event - to ensure the details of the fit and quality setting are included in the saved file.

<h1 class="auto-style1"><br>Viewing Historical observations</h1>
<p class="auto-style1">The viewing of a past asteroid occultation is governed by the controls in the Historical Observations box.
<P align=center class="auto-style1"><img src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20Historical.png" width="240">
<p class="auto-style1">Most of the controls in the box are used to set the list of events that are listed in the drop-down box at the bottom of the 
area. The event data displayed in the drop-down box are:<ul class="auto-style3">
	<li>Year, month and day of the event</li>
	<li># - when shape models are available, and all have been fitted</li>
	<li>† - when shape models are available that have not been fitted</li>
	<li>Asteroid number and name</li>
	<li>number of observations (records) - excluding prediction lines</li>
	<li>number of observed chords (limited to the primary star)</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style1">Use the radio buttons to set whether to select the event on the basis of date, by asteroid name, asteroid number, but the number of observation lines (Records), or events involving a planet or a moon of a planet.<ul class="auto-style3">
<li>When <B>Date </B>is selected, select the year range with the drop-down box. The main drop down box will list events in that date range, sorted by date.
 <li>When <B>Name </B>is selected, select the relevant letter for the first letter of the asteroid's name from the drop-down box. The main drop down box will list all events involving asteroids commencing with that letter (or number), sorted alphanumerically, then by date.
<li>When <B>Number </B>is selected, select the number range with the drop-down box. The main drop down box will list asteroids in that number range, sorted by number then date.
<li><strong>Shape Models</strong> limits the displayed events to those having shape models available.
<li><strong>Unfitted Models</strong> limits the displayed events to those where shape models are available that have not been fitted.
<li>When <B>#Records</B> is selected, the main drop down box will list all events sorted by the number of records.
<li>When <B>#Chords</B> is selected, the main drop down box will list all events sorted by the number of 
observed chords.
<li>When <B>Planets only</B> is selected, the main drop down box will list events involving planets or their moons, sorted by planet number, then moon number.
</ul>
With any of these selections, the text immediately above the main drop-down box gives the number of items in the main drop-down box, and the total number of 
events.<p>&nbsp;To display an event, merely select the event in the drop-down box. the observations will be displayed on the form, and the events plotted.

<p class="auto-style1">There are two processes for importing observations that 
are in the native format used in Occult:</p>
<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;Individual files can be opened/edited/saved using 
the menu item <strong>File... Save</strong>. Multiple files can be opened, 
edited and (typically) added to the Historical file of observations, using the 
menu item <strong>File... Open Multiple files</strong>.<br></p>
<ul class="auto-style3">
<li>Similarly, individual events can be pasted using the menu item FileTo add a complete event report from a report that is already in the OBS format used by Occult - highlight all lines of the observation. <B>Copy</B>, then select <I><B>Paste..Ne w event - OBS format</B></I>. This will copy all the events into the editor, and complete all the star/asteroid details where possible.
<li>To add one or more observation lines in the OBS format - highlight the one or several observation lines, <B>Copy</B>, then select <I><B>Paste..New observation line [or Lines] - OBS format</B></I>. This will add the events to those in the editor. 
<br><B>Note 1</B> - unlike pasting from Euraster and JP, you can add more than one observation in a single Paste. 
<br><B>Note 2</B> - if adding observations to an event in the Historical observations - you must first do a <B>File ... Save as  </B>with the event. Then add the observations and save the updated file. Incorporation of the updated event into the observations file will require a manual edit of the file.

<p><B>Prediction line</B><br>
<li> To add a prediction line - either from the path coordinate list in Steve Preston's site, or from the Occult path prediction. 
Highlight (select) a line in the prediction that relates to a location near to the observers. 
From the menu line, select <strong>with Prediction....&nbsp; Create Prediction 
line for Observations Report... Occult</strong> Then in the 
Observations Editor, click <strong>Paste... Prediction line</strong>.

</ul>
<p class="auto-style1"><B>IMPORTANT </B>Always check the data for both completeness and correctness before adding the event to the Historical observations file.
