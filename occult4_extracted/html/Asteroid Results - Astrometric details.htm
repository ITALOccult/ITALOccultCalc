<p>The output has three sections. The first is details of the star. The second 
is the solution for the time of the event. And the third section is the solution 
for the time of geocentric conjunction.</p>
<p>If the observation involves one or more satellites, the 2nd and 3rd sections 
are repeated for each satellite.</p>
<p>The contents of each section are as follows.</p>
<h2>Star details</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The star identifier used in Occult. It will be one of HIP (Hipparcos), 
	TYC (Tycho2), UCAC4, or Ghhhhhh.s-ddmmss (a coordinate identifier)</li>
	<li>The Gaia identifier</li>
	<li>the Source of the position.&nbsp; As at 2020 most positions are sourced from Gaia 
	DR2. However stars brighter than about mag 4 are sourced from 
	Hipparcos 2, and a very small number of stars are sourced from UCAC4</li>
	<li>the star's estimated diameter, derived using the Gaia Apsis-FLAME 
	estimate of the radius (in solar radii) and the stellar parallax</li>
	<li>Whether the RUWE (Renormalized Unit Weight Error) value indicates the 
	position may be in error</li>
	<li>whether the Non-duplicate source flag indicates the star might have a 
	companion</li>
	<li>the blue, green and red magnitudes</li>
	<li>the GCRS position of the star at the date of the event. That is, the 
	position with proper motion and parallax applied. In addition, for star 
	positions taken from DR2, the position is corrected for the frame rotation 
	error present in DR2 positions for stars brighter than 12.5</li>
	<li>the uncertainty in the star position - including the uncertainties from 
	the frame rotation error correction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Asteroid position at event time</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The event time, and uncertainty - expressed as fraction of a day, and in 
	hh mm ss.ss. [Issues of uncertainty are discussed below]. For most events, 
	the event time is the average of all observed D and R times of the chords 
	used in the solution. However:<ul>
		<li>&nbsp;if the event involved a double star, the event time is based 
		on the times of the events involving the primary component;</li>
		<li>if the event involved an asteroid, the event time is based on the 
		chords of the satellite, not the asteroid. The problem is that the 
		observed event times for the main body and satellite will usually be 
		different. This issue is minimized by using the satellite as the primary 
		reference point, and moving the observed observations for the main body 
		on the basis of that observed time - on the basis that the motion of the 
		primary body will be essentially that of the system as a whole, whereas 
		that of the satellite may not be. However where a satellite ephemeris is 
		available from Miriade, the motion of the satellite is also allowed for.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>the number of observed chords used in the solution</li>
	<li>the observed geocentric distance (km) of the centre of the shadow, 
	derived from the fit to the observations.</li>
	<li>the corresponding offsets in RA and Dec - in the apparent reference 
	frame (arcsec)</li>
	<li>those offsets as converted to the J2000 reference frame (arcsec)</li>
	<li>the gravitational deflection of the star relative to the asteroid 
	(arcsec)</li>
	<li>the derived position of the asteroid in the J2000&nbsp; GCRS reference frame. 
	[<strong><em>Note: strictly speaking, the position is in the the geocentric 
	reference frame aligned with ICRS, and is not co-moving with the Earth</em></strong>]</li>
	<li>the uncertainties :<ul>
		<li>from the star position (including any DR2 reference frame 
		uncertainties)</li>
		<li>from the fit of an asteroid profile to the observations</li>
		<li>the total uncertainties, expressed in mas, and in secs-time and 
		arcsec</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Asteroid position at Geocentric conjunction</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Where satellites are involved, each satellite has its own solution.</li>
	<li>The time of geocentric conjunction - expressed as fraction of a day, and 
	in hh mm ss.ss. </li>
	<li>The separations and uncertainty at conjunction (in arcsec), and the 
	Position Angle from the star</li>
	<li>The corresponding J2000 GCRS position of the asteroid or satellite. [<strong><em>Note: 
	strictly speaking, the position is in the the geocentric reference frame 
	aligned with ICRS, and is not co-moving with the Earth</em></strong>]</li>
	<li>the uncertainties :<ul>
		<li>from the star position (including any DR2 reference frame 
		uncertainties)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>the uncertainties<ul>
		<li>uncertainties in the star position (including any DR2 reference 
		frame uncertainties)</li>
		<li>Uncertainties affecting the time of conjunction<ul>
			<li>recording uncertainties</li>
			<li>from the fit of an asteroid profile to the observations</li>
			<li>The total of these uncertainties, expressed as a time 
			uncertainty (in days or seconds) or the along-track uncertainty in 
			mas (with the associated position angle)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Uncertainty in the across-track direction - in mas (with the 
		associated position angle).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Sources of uncertainty</h1>
<h2>Star position</h2>
<p>The base uncertainty is a combination of the catalogue uncertainty in the 
star position at catalogue epoch, the uncertainty in the proper motion 
propagated to the date of the event, and the uncertainty in the parallax as 
applicable to the date of the event.</p>
<p>In addition, Gaia DR2 positions for stars righter than mag 12.5 have a frame 
rotation error that requires correction for both position at epoch and proper 
motions. Those corrections have their own uncertainties.</p>
<h2>Time of the event</h2>
<p>The uncertainty in the time of the event is calculated as the 
root-mean-square of the uncertainty in the mid-time of each observed chord.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons many observations in the dataset do 
not have observer-specified uncertainty values. As a result, the uncertainty in 
the mid-time of an event has been determined using both the reported 
uncertainties, and estimated uncertainties where uncertainties are not 
specified. This has been attained using the following scheme, which is a 
combination of an estimated uncertainty based on certain factors, and an 
associated weighting.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For chords where uncertainties are reported, the mid-time uncertainty is 
	the average of the D and R uncertainty, with a <strong>weight of 6</strong></li>
	<li>Where uncertainties are not specified:<ul>
		<li>For <strong>Video or photometer </strong>observations<ul>
			<li>if the time source was <strong>GPS, radio</strong> :&nbsp;
			<strong>0.5 secs</strong> with a <strong>weight of 3</strong></li>
			<li>if the time source was a <strong>stopwatch</strong> :&nbsp;
			<strong>0.5 secs</strong> with a <strong>weight of 2</strong></li>
			<li>for any other time source (<strong>NTP, phone, internal recorder 
			clock,</strong> other) :&nbsp; <strong>1.5 secs</strong> with a
			<strong>weight of 1</strong></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>For <strong>sequential images or driftscan</strong><ul>
			<li><strong>1.0 secs</strong> with a <strong>weight of 2</strong></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>For <strong>visual observations</strong> and other observations<ul>
			<li><strong>1.0 secs</strong> with a <strong>weight of 1</strong></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>This time uncertainty is expressed in the <strong>At event</strong> solution 
as an uncertainty in the time of the event. In the <strong>At conjunction
</strong>solution, it is expressed as a <strong>recording uncertainty</strong>.</p>
<h2>Asteroid fit</h2>
<p>Where there are chords sufficient to fit a circle or ellipse, the 
least-squares solution for that fit flows through from rms uncertainties in the 
location of the center of that fit to uncertainties in the RA and declination. 
For the 'at conjunction' solution, the uncertainties in RA and Dec are 
transformed into uncertainties along-track and across track.</p>
<p>If the observed chords have been fitted to a shape model, and this fact 
specified in the solution, the uncertainty in the position of the shadow is set 
to 0.02 of the nominal asteroid diameter.</p>
<h3>Situation for 'astrometry only' events</h3>
<p>Where there are insufficient chords to properly solve for the asteroid size 
or shape, the location of the center of the shadow is poorly defined. The 
approach for this situation is markedly different for the 'at event, and at 
conjunction solutions</p>
<p>For the <strong>At event </strong>solution, the uncertainty is set at 0.4 of 
the asteroid's diameter - in both coordinates - and is expressed in mas. In 
general this relatively large uncertainty supersedes the uncertainty in th event 
time.</p>
<p>for the <strong>At Conjunction </strong>solution, the across-track 
uncertainty is set at 0.4 of the asteroid's diameter, in mas. However the 
along-track uncertainty is primarily expressed as a time uncertainty, being a 
combination of two components</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Firstly, there is the the uncertainty in the event time, 
as discussed above - and listed as 'recording uncertainties'</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Secondly, there is an uncertainty, based on 
the following assessment of the chord lengths;</p>
<ul class="auto-style3">
	<li>For the extremely elongated asteroids (216) Kleopatra, (433) Eros, and 
	(25143) Itokawa, an uncertainty of 0.2 of maximum duration; otherwise</li>
	<li>for a chord length &gt;0.8 of the expected maximum event duration, an 
	uncertainty of 0.05 of the full duration</li>
	<li>for a chord length &gt;0.6 (and less than 0.8) of the expected maximum 
	event duration, an uncertainty of 0.1 of the full duration</li>
	<li>for shorter durations - an uncertainty of 0.2 of the full duration</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style2">The final uncertainty for the asteroid fit is derived as the root-mean-square of these 
uncertainties.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">The overall along-track uncertainty is the combination of 
the recording uncertainty and the chord-derived uncertainty</p>
<p class="auto-style2">An angular mas equivalent&nbsp; for the combined recording and asteroid fit&nbsp; 
along-track uncertainties is also provided.</p>
