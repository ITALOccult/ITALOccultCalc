	<li><strong><a name="OW"></a>Save listed events as a 'Personal' OW feed</strong> Saves the 
occultation elements of the events in the format needed for OccultWatcher 
	personal predictions. The method of saving the file depends upon whether 
	OccultWatcher is running when this function is used.<br>
	<ul><li>If OccultWatcher is running, the file called <strong>OccelmntSubsetForOW.dat 
		</strong>will be written directly to the required <strong>OccultWatcher\Personal

	</strong>If you are running <span class="auto-style2">OccultWatcher </span>'OW' on your computer, simply 
copy this file to the OW directory <strong>OccultWatcher\Personal </strong>(making no 
change to the file name), and the events 
will be included in <span class="auto-style2">OccultWatcher</span>.</li></ul> This way, you can generate your own list of 
events specific to your location, and have them appear in
	<span class="auto-style2">OccultWatcher</span>. 
	The events will not appear until OccultWatcher has done an update of the 
	feeds. You can learn more about this option in <span class="auto-style2">OccultWatcher

<h3>Sort Events</h3>
<p class="auto-style8">Sorts the list of events by any of Date, Diameter (km), Diameter (arcsec), duration, Star magnitude, combined magnitude, magnitude drop Visual, Magnitude drop Red, elongation, distance, probability, name, number or star number. The list as initially displayed is sorted by date.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h4>List stars occulted more than once</h4>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style8">The last option in the Sort menu list is to list events 
involving the same star. This is only likely to be relevant when a large number 
of events are predicted - but it enables the ready identification of events 
involving the same star. This can be useful for studying characteristics of that 
star using different occultation events, or for applying positional offsets to 
the star position based on the first observed event (if such is justified).</p>
<h3>Generate predictions for all listed events</h3>
<p class="auto-style8">This menu group automatically generates prediction files for all events listed on the summary. 
It is particularly designed for those creating web pages, including those creating feeds for
<A href="OccultWatcherFeed.htm">OccultWatcher</a>. To avoid generating predictions of events that are already contained in Steve Preston's 
<I>Future.dat </I>and<I> FutureAll540.dat </I>files, check 'Exclude if in Future.dat' in the 4th filter box. {You should ensure you have up-to-date versions of 
the <I>Future.dat </I>and <I>FutureAll540.dat </I>files.}</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h3>Set scale for World maps ( = x.x)&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt;</h3>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style8">This setting is for the scale of the world map that is 
generated by the autogeneration routines. The drop-down lists provides the 
available scales - from 1.0 to 8.0. The scale setting is retained between 
sessions.</p>
<p class="auto-style8">When the center line of the occultation path misses the 
Earth, the world map is scaled such that the map shows the occultation path 
relative to the World - irrespective of the selected plot scale.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h3>Plot the maps Path/Site-centered [xxxx]</h3>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style8">When the map scale is greater than 1, the plotted map is 
centered on one of two bases. The reference point for plotting the map is the 
site location set in the selection filter box for Visibility - 
irrespective of whether or not the visibility filter is checked. </p>
<p class="auto-style8">The map can be centered on that site location, or on the 
point along the occultation path that is closest to that site location. The 
current setting is shown in brackets at the end of the menu entry (and the menu 
item is checked when the setting is 'Path'). The setting is retained between 
sessions.</p>
<p class="auto-style8">Anyone using the Autogeneration function should assess 
which of these two options best meets their needs. There is no material 
difference when the path passes close to the nominated site. However the 
difference can be quite significant when the path is located some distance from 
the nominated site.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h3><strong><span class="auto-style18">Create files&nbsp; [StationSort using 
	site file =&gt;</span></strong> </h3>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style8">This function generates a set of files that can be used 
to create a web page containing detailed information about each event. One of 
the files that can be created is a file containing local predictions and path 
distances for locations in a Site file. The 
drop-down lists provides an alphabetically-sorted list of available Site files 
that can be used to generate that output file - including an option of 'None'. The selected site file is retained between 
sessions - but has to be re-selected each time the function is used.</p>
<p class="auto-style8"><B><span class="auto-style2">IMPORTANT</span> </B><em>To use this option, you must specify the files you want to have generated under 
</em> 
<B><em>User Settings</em></B><em>, in the box </em> <B><em>Asteroid occultations - Search and display</em></B><em>.  To include city locations in the Occult map, you need to specify the site file in the 
</em>

</em>
</p>
<p class="auto-style8"><span class="auto-style3">IMPORTANT -</span><span class="auto-style2"> change

unless you are intend using the old functionality (which is being retained for a period of time.)

</em>

</p>
<p class="auto-style8">The Autogenerate function works as follows</p>
<ul type=a class="auto-style4">
	<li>The output files are written to the directory <B>Occult 4\AutoGenerated Asteroids.</B><li>
	One of the potential files that is generated <span class="auto-style9">
	[{xxxx}_Site.txt] </span>gives the mid-time of the event 
	for each site in a Site file, with the results being sorted by order of distance from 
	the path. When you click this menu item, a submenu will list all the 
	available Site files. Click the Site file you wish to use, or 'None' if you 
	do not want to use a site file.<li>The site file <em>used to plot cities on the Occult maps</em> is that specified in the 
	<B>User Settings.</B>
	<li>An index of the events generated is written to the file FileIndex.txt. Each entry is a text identifier of the event, followed by a unique identifier;
	<li>A series of control files is written to the subdirectory MJD. The file has the name of the unique identifier, and contains the Modified Julian day number of the date the relevant occultation element file was created.<li>Before creating a set of output files for an event, the program checks to see if there is a corresponding file in the MJD directory. If the file exists, the program compares the creation date of the current occultation elements with the date stored in the check file - and only generates output if the elements creation date is later than that stored in the check file. [This means that, for example, you can generate a summary using Steve Preston's Future.dat file, and the 
Autogenerate function will only create files for new or revised occultation elements.]

	This option creates the set of files needed to be uploaded to create a feed 
	of occultation events for <a href="http://www.occultwatcher.net/">Occult 
	Watcher</a>. If you have negotiated a feed for OccultWatcher, you will need

		<li>
		<p class="auto-style10">The files will now be created in a directory
		<strong>Occult 4\OWfeeds\{<em>feedname</em>}</strong>, ready to be

		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="auto-style10">You can generate the files for different feeds 
		(or different date ranges) without losing the previous files, simply by

<h2>Accurate prediction for a selected event</h2>
<p>Events found when searching over a lengthy period of time, or without using 
the JPL Horizons search option, may have reduced accuracy because of limitations 
with the basic numerical integration scheme implemented in Occult. If you 
identify an event in a list where you want a very accurate prediction, select 
the event, and then right-click on it. This will enable you to generate an 
updated prediction for that event.</p>
<p>Note that this functionality has been superseded by the check-box option on 
the Search form: <span class="auto-style19">use Horizons ephemeris (predictions will 
be slow)</span> - which provides for accurate predictions for multiple objects.</p>
&nbsp;<h1 class="auto-style12">Information displayed</h1>
<p>The form displays summary information about events in three formats. The primary distinction depends upon whether or not the list is filtered on the basis of being visible from a specified location. If the list is filtered on being visible, the information for occultations by the planets (but not their satellites) include local event times. Examples of the three formats are as follows.

<h3>The information displayed in the list is:
</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Date,  U.T: </b>The date and time of closest approach. The hierarchy 
	of the U.T of the event time displayed is:<ol class="auto-style5">
		<li>if filtered on site location - the time is for the closest approach 
		to the location; </li>
		<li>if filtered on the region (Path crosses...) BUT NOT the site 
		location - the time is for the closest approach to the centre of the 
		region. </li>
		<li>otherwise the time is for the closest approach to the centre of the Earth.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Diameter: </b>The objects diameter, both in km and arcsec. For the planets it is the equatorial diameter. For Venus the diameter is for the top of the clouds.
	</li>
	<li><b>Duration: </b>The expected duration of the occultation on the basis of the diameter, assuming a central occultation. The time is typically given in seconds (s), but fort long events can be given in minutes (m). 
	</li>
	<li><b>Star Mag: </b>The visual magnitude of the star. Note that this magnitude may not be a strict V magnitude - depending on the source of the star position.
	</li>
	<li><b>Mag-Drop: </b>The expected magnitude drop, on the basis of the star's V and R magnitudes and the magnitude of the occulting object. 
	</li>
	<li><strong>*:</strong> a flag  to indicate there are 'nearby' stars that 
	are brighter than [target star magnitude + 1.0].<ul>‡ = there are stars 
	within 5&quot;, and the magnitude drop has been corrected to include all such stars.
	<br>† = there are stars within 15".</ul></li>
	<li><b>Elon: </b>The solar elongation of the star at the time of the event.
	</li>
	<li><b>% Illum: </b>For occultations by the Planets, the percent illumination of the planet. This is of particular importance for Mercury, Venus and Mars.
	</li>
	<li><b>Star No. : </b>The star identification number
</li>
	<li><b>d : </b>A flag to indicate there is double star information available, variable star information, or that the stellar diameter is significant. The flags are: 
	<ul>
		<li>W the star is listed in WDS 
</li>
		<li>D the star is a double from some source (such as the Interferometric catalogue). It may or may not be listed in WDS 
		</li>
		<li>V the star is a variable star. (It may also be a double star) 
</li>
		<li>If the flag is one of s, w, d or v, this indicates that stellar diameter is at least 1 mas - and will therefore have an effect on the occultation. The codes w, d or v indicate the star is also listed in one of the catalogues as per the capital letter 
		equivalent</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Rely</strong> The reliability of the star position (RUWE in 
	GAIA), Values &lt;1.4 indicate the star position is reliable. For larger values 
	there may be questions about the reliability of the position. Similarly if 
	no value is given. A value of 0.0 is usually associated with a lack of 
	proper motion, and as a result the position of the star has significant 
	uncertainty.</li>
	<li><b>Planet No  Name: </b>The identification of the occulting object. For asteroids, it is the asteroid number and its designation. For planets it is the name of the planet or moon. The identification numer used is of the form PxMyy, where X is the planet number, and yy is the number of the moon in the system of that planet.

<h1 class="auto-style12">Filter options</h1>
<p>The event list can be filtered on a range of options, using check boxes at the top of the form. The status of those check boxes is retained between sessions.
</p>
<p>To filter the list, set the check boxes, then click <B>List events</B>.
</p>
<p>The various filters that can be applied are:
</p>
<p>=================================================
</p>
<P align=left><img src="ListDisplayFilter_Site.png"><br></p>
<p>Filter on whether or not the event is visible from the specified location.
Includes events if, at the specified location and time of closest approach to that location 
</p>
<ol class="auto-style5">
	<li>For stars brighter than mag 4, the only criterion is that the asteroid must be at least 1 deg above the horizon
	</li>
	<li>For stars fainter than mag 4 - no events if the sun's altitude is greater than -1 deg. And no events if the asteroid's altitude is less than 5 deg and the sun's altitude greater than -9 deg.
	</li>
	<li>A general star faintness test applied for varying altitudes of the sun. The limits are 4.0 @ -1°, 7.9 @ -4°, 10.5 @ -6°, 13.2 @ -8, 15.8 @ -10°   
	</li>
</ol>
<p>The latitude/longitude values are retained between sessions. You can use the<A  href="Site%20editor.htm"> site files</a> to insert the coordinates of a selected site, by clicking the <b>Select site</b> button.(This 
also sets the telescope aperture in the next filter group.) This will also allow you to insert your home site location (set in the User Settings) by clicking the <B>Home </B>
button on the form that appears to select from the site files.
<p>The longitude and latitude values here are also used as the default site location for plotting the occultation maps.
<p><strong><em>If this filter is selected,</em></strong> you can also set
<ul>
	<li>the probability of the event occurring at the specified site location</li>
	<li>the distance of the path from the location <strong><em>(km) OR</em></strong> the minimum distance of the asteroid from the star, 
and the altitude at that location The path distance is intended to limit events to those where the observer is prepared to travel to the occultation region. However the distance calculation is approximate, and becomes unreliable when the distance is of the order of 1000km or more or the star is at low altitude. 
	</li>
	<li>the sky-separation of the star and asteroid. This may be more relevant for filtering events that might occur at the home location.
	</li>
	<li>exclude events that occur below a specified altitude at that location.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also filter on the basis of your local horizon. 
This allows you to include the effects of trees, buildings, mountain 
ranges, and the like. For this filter to be functional, you need to set your 
local site horizon. You do this from the Menu bar - <strong>File... Set the elevation of 
local horizon</strong>. This will bring up the form:<p>

<img src="ListDisplayFilter_LocalHorizon.png"><p>
Simply set the horizon altitude (in degrees) that you want to apply for the azimuth range above each entry. To retain 
the settings, simply click <strong>Save &amp; Exit</strong>. <strong>Undo all 
changes </strong>will return all fields to the value they had when the form was 
opened. <strong>Set all elevations to zero</strong> does just that!. And <strong>
Exit with no changes </strong>quits the form without saving any changes.<p>
&nbsp;<p>
&nbsp;=================================================
 
<P align=left><img src="ListDisplayFilter_Various.png"><br>
<p>Filter on any of the following parameters:
<ul>
	<li>the expected magnitude drop
</li>
	<li>the star magnitude
</li>
	<li>the expected maximum duration of a central occultation
</li>
	<li>the diameter of the occulting asteroid (including the moons of major planets)
</li>
	<li>the solar elongation of the star. Usually only events involving a quite 
	bright star cab be observed at solar elongations less than 20°
</li>
	<li>The capabilities of your optical recording system. You can specify the 
	telescope's aperture (up to 95 cm) and whether or not you are using a camera 
	where you can set the exposure duration (including integrating cameras). 
	These will be set on the basis of settings in the Site file (if you use that 
	option in the previous group). <br>
	<span class="auto-style9">This test works on the basis (assumption) that a 20cm telescope, using an exposure of 0.037 secs (half-way between PAL and NTSC video frame rates), can reliably record a star at magnitude 12.0 under reasonable conditions. Changes in the aperture appropriately changes the magnitude limit. If the exposure can be varied, the magnitude limit is set such that at at least 3 exposures can be taken during the maximum duration. If the predicted magnitude drop is less than 0.5 mags, a larger number of exposures must be possible during the maximum duration.
	</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>=================================================
</p>
<P align=left><img src="ListDisplayFilter_Region.png"><br></p>
<p>This filter identifies those events where the occultation path (as defined by its limits) crosses into a 'quadrilateral'. This filter is new to Occult 4.5.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this filter is to identify all occultation events that might occur in a region. That region might be defined by the various locations of a group of observers, or by the region an observer is prepared to travel to observe events.
</p>
<p>This filter will exclude all events where at least some of the path does not pass across the defined 
quadrilateral. However it does not test for the Sun's altitude or the objects altitude - you need to apply a different filter for those.
</p>
<p>To set the filter, the user needs to specify the four corners of the quadrilateral area defining the region. Those coordinates are specified as 
latitude/longitude coordinates, in degrees. There is no requirement for the 
quadrilateral to be in any way regular in shape. To assist in specifying the coordinates, the box indicates the traditional directions of NW, NE, SW and SE - but in fact the ordering of the four corners of the quadrilateral is irrelevant.
</p>
<p>The region can be specified by manually entering the coordinates of the four 
corners of the quadrilateral. However, more conveniently you can specify multiple 
quadrilaterals by using the Menu option
<a href="Asteroid%20predictions%20-%20Edit%20regions.htm">File... Edit list of regions</a>, 
and select any of the regions you have created from the drop-down list of regions 
at the top of this filter box.</p>
<h3>Using the Region filter</h3>
<p>The region filter can be used in several different ways:</p>
<ol>
	<li>For personal 
predictions, you can specify a relatively small quadrilateral surrounding your 
home site, to create a filter that identifies events that come close to you.</li>
	<li>For personal predictions, you can specify a quadrilateral surrounding your 
home site, taking into account roads &amp; topography where you might be prepared to 
travel. This will create a filter that identifies event that cross the region 
you are prepared to travel to - rather than just being close to you.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;For 
creators of feeds for OccultWatcher. You can set up a region that matches the 
distribution of observers in your part of the world.</li>
	<li>For creators of feeds 
for OccultWatcher - where you have discrete groups of observers. By way of 
Example, in Australia/New Zealand region, there are groups of observers in 
Western Australia near Perth, in South-Eastern Australia 
(Melbourne/Canberra/Sydney), in North-Eastern Australia (Brisbane/Townsville), 
and New Zealand. To create an optimal feed, what one can do is:</li>
</ol>
<ul class="auto-style4">
	<li>specify regions for each of the several locations</li>
	<li>run the search for the desired time interval</li>
	<li>select a first region using the File... Select Region... submenu, and 
	filter the events for that region (applying any other filters as 
	appropriate). Then Save the list using the <strong>Save listed events</strong> 
	button&nbsp; (or the equivalent menu item).</li>
	<li>select a second region using the File... Select Region... submenu. Then 
	Save the list using the <strong>Save listed events</strong> button </li>
	<li>Repeat for each of the regions</li>
	<li>Now, using <strong>File... Open</strong>, open one of those saved files. 
	[This will result in the loss of the overall search results, unless you have 
	saved them.]</li>
	<li>Then, using <strong>File... Open and Merge</strong>, open each of the 
	remaining files you have saved. </li>
</ul>
<p>This will give you a list of all events that cross one or more of your 
selected regions (with any duplicate entries being removed), from which you can 
create an optimized OccultWatcher feed.<p>=================================================
<P align=left><img src="ListDisplayFilter_Special.png"><br>
<p>Filter on any of the following parameters:
<ul>
	<li>Occultations by a specified major planet. [The moons of a specified planet are also incuded]
	</li>
	<li>asteroids having a shape model
</li>
	<li>asteroids known to have moons
</li>
	<li>asteroids known to have rings
</li>
	<li>Events where the path uncertainty is less than a specified multiple of 
	the Earth's radius. The allowable range is 0.2 to 4.0 Earth radii. This 
	option is essentially for use with predictions of TNO objects (such as 
	LuckyStar and RIO), where initial predictions can have a path uncertainty of 
	many Earth radii - allowing the identification of events which have a better 
	probability. of being observed.</li>
	<li>Exclude events if they are contained in Steve Preston's 'Future.xml' or 'FutureAll.xml' prediction files. This option avoids duplication with the Steve Preston predictions. It is particularly significant for those creating prediction feeds for OccultWatcher, where it is desirable to avoid duplicate predictions. Note that the exclusion is dependant upon the star identification - and duplicate events may not be detected if different star catalogues or number formats are used.

<h2>Issues particular to binary asteroids in Miriade</h2>
Where a search includes a binary asteroid with an ephemeris available at the IMCCE 
<a href="http://vo.imcce.fr/webservices/miriade/">Miriade</a> system, Occult will generate predictions for each component, and for each available solution. The following table is an example 
list of events generated by Occult.

Features to note in this list are:


<ul>
	<li>The system has three components: Camilla, S2001-107-1, and S2016-107-1</li>
	<li>The Miriade system has three different orbit solutions (represented by 
	#1, #2 and #3). However orbit solution #3 is only available for two 
	components.</li>
	<li>One entry is unqualified by a # symbol. [It need not be the first 
	entry.] This entry is based on the normal ephemeris for the asteroid, having 
	no regard to any information from the Miriade system. For systems where the 
	satellites are small compared to the primary, the prediction for this 
	unqualified event will almost certainly be the same as for the events 
	qualified by #1, #2 etc. However in systems where the masses of the two 
	components are similar, each component will be offset from the system's barycenter 
	such that the unqualified prediction will unreliable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each event in such lists are treated as entirely different events, and all 
the usual outputs are available in the usual manner by clicking on an event. </p>
<p>However there may well be special interest in binary asteroid events, and the 
following provides some guidance about how you might select &amp; display relevant 
entries. In all instances, if you have a search covering multiple events, the 
starting point will be to use the Date filter to limit the output to the 
relevant date, and the asteroid number filter (but not name) to limit the list 
to the one event and asteroid system.</p>
<ul>
	<li>To select events for a particular solution: In the filter for <strong>
	Asteroid name contains</strong>, enter the solution tag (and nothing else). 
	In this case, the options are #1, #2 or #3</li>
	<li>Having limited the list to a single solution, you can sensibly plot the 
	paths of all components for that solution in Google Earth, using the menu 
	item&nbsp; <strong>File... Plot all paths in GoogleEarth</strong>.</li>
	<li>Similarly, you can create a .KMZ file including the paths of all 
	components for that solution (which can then be distributed or used on a web 
	site), using <strong>File.... Save all paths as GoogleEarth KMZ file</strong></li>
</ul>
