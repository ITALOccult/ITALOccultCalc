<H1>User asteroids Edit</H1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<P>Occult maintains two files of 'user' asteroids to use with predictions:
<li>UserMinorPlanetElements.dat; and
<li>UserMinorPlanetElements_Lunar.dat;</P>
<p>The first of these files is used for asteroid occultation predictions; the second is used for lunar occultation predictions. The file structure is the same; however when the editor is used for the Lunar occultation file, extra functionality is provided to import the brightest objects from the main file of asteroid elements.</p>

<h3>Points to note</h3>
<ul type=1><li>Occult integrates orbits based on a 10-day intefration scheme. For an orbit to be integrated, the epoch must be a julian day number of the form nnnnnn<b>0.50000</b>. Otherwise Occult will merely use the osculating elements.
<li>For objects passing close to the Earth, the change in the orbital elements over a 10-day period can become significantly non-linear. When this occurs, you should not use the normal integrated orbit for the object over the several days of its passage. Rather you should extract orbital elements from the JPL-Horizons system at a small interval of time (eg 6 hours), conduct a search using those elements, excluding events that are not within +/-3 hours of the epoch. For extremely close passages (such as Apophis on Easter Sunday, 13 April 2029), an even smaller interval will be required.
</ul>

<h2>Common functions</h2>
<p>When opened, the form displays all the elements currently in the file in the top half of the form. As the cursor is moved to different lines, the elements on the selected line are displayed in corresponding boxes at the bottom half of the form, ready for editing.</p>

<p>When the editor is open, you will not be able to access any other functions of Occult</p>

<p>You can delete a selected line, or all items in the list, using the relevant buttons. You will be asked to confirm deletion before it occurs.</p>

<p>The two most common editing functions are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>to <B>Add </B>elements from the <span class="auto-style3">JPL-Horizons system 
	</span>into the editor. <A href="User%20Asteroids%20Horizons.htm">
	<span class="auto-style2"><strong>Details</strong></span></a> </li>
	<li>&nbsp;to import elements from the
	<a href="Maintenance%20convert%20Astorb.htm">main file</a> of asteroid elements maintained by Occult. When this is selected, a form displaying all the asteroids in that file is displayed - from which you select either a single asteroid, or a contiguous range of asteroids.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also import the elements contained in the '.oel' file generated by the <A href="http://adams.dm.unipi.it/~orbmaint/orbfit/" target = _blank>Orbfit</a> program, by clicking on the <B>Import from .oel file </B>button. When clicked, select the relevant .oel file. The elements will be added to the list, with the diameter and moon data being taken from the main file of elements. <B>Note </B>- when generating an .oel file for a particular event, generate it for a timne close to the event. If it will be used for searching for events, ensure the epoch is a 10-day Julian date - so that the orbit will be integrated by Occult.</p>


<p>You can also import selected comets from the file of comet orbital elements maintained by Occult (by way of download from the Minor Planet Center). The comets are listed in a drop-down box. Select the desired comet, and click 'Import Periodic Comet'. Note that the diameter is arbitrarily set at 10km, and the positional uncertainty is set at 3". Note that for comets of high eccentricity, Occult uses non-integrated osculating elements. In asteroid predictions, this is indicated in outputs, where the object name has a trailing "**".</p>

<p>You can also import all 'current' comets, by clicking the <b>Import all current comets</b> button. This uses a file from the Minor Planet Center to select comets on the basis that they have been observed in the previous 6 months, and that their last observed magnitude was brighter than mag 14 or 18, or to include irrespective of magnitude. [The default magnitude selection is set at 18.] If the file giving the dates of last observations is more than one month old, you will be advised of this fact.

<p>You can manually edit elements; and when this is done you have the option to replace the original set of elements, or add the edited elements as a new object.</p>


<p>&nbsp;<p><B>IMPORTANT</B>. <span class="auto-style1">Changes to the file do not occur as the changes are made. They only occur when the 'Save List' button is pressed. This means that if you make changes that you want to undo, just close the form and start again. On the other hand, you must remember to Save before you close the form. [At this time there is no warning about unsaved changes.]</span></p>


<h2>Additional functions for the Lunar occultation user file</h2>
<p>The user file for use with Lunar occultations provides the sole basis for predicting lunar occultations of asteroids. Given that most 
asteroids are <I>very </I>faint, there are only a small number of asteroids that ever become bright enough to be observable in a lunar occultations.</p>

<p>The additional functionality provided is to automatically import all asteroids having a mean opposition magnitude greater than a certain 'mean opposition magnitude'. Note that while a main-belt asteroid might 
occasionally be a magnitude or so brighter than the mean opposition magnitude, for most of the time it will be significantly fainter.</p>

<p>While there is no limit to the number of asteroids you can include in the file, each additional asteroid slows the lunar occultation prediction. Additionally, if the predictions are being generated for a date many years from the present time, there will be an additional overhead in integrating the orbit. Generally, you should limit the number of asteroids to 10 or 20 at most, unless you have a specific need to include more asteroids.</p>
