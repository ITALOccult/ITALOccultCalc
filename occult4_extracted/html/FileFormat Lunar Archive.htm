<B>IOTA2008 Archive format for lunar occultation observations</B>

VERSION 1.7   13 Feb 2010

Comments:
1. The format does not include any computed data items.
2. The format covers both the ILOC dataset, the RGO dataset, and future observations.
3. Provision is made to record corrections to the data, without losing the original data. Three
   types of correction are envisaged: (1) date/time (2) star identifier, and (3) site coords. 
4. The Archive format includes a number of field definitions that are intended to be used solely
   with the ILOC and RGO data. All new observations should comply with the IOTA2008 Report Format.

                           (video) partial disappearance (always >25% of full light). 
                           (visual) a short disappearance-reappearance - too close to separately
                            time.
                     F  Flash. The mid-time of a flash event. Usually only occurs during a graze,

                            column 48.

                          observed or predicted graze profile – although the time might also be
                          simply the mid-time of the graze. Usually only used when other
                          observers in a graze observation have recorded D &/or R events
                     S  Start or resume. Only used in a graze observation, to indicate periods
                          when the observer was observing.
                     E  End or pause. Only used in a graze observation, to indicate periods when
                          the observer was not observing.

                          automatically generated to indicate the computed residual is
                          unsatisfactory. The exact criteria applied depends on the basis for
                          correcting the limb for its irregularities. Events with this flag
                          have not been individually investigated to determine whether there
                          is an error in the reported data, or whether the observation was
                          adversely affected by poor observing conditions (that is, is invalid).

                          of errors in several of date + time, star, and site location, 
                          the reported observation cannot be plausibly associated with a
                          relevant occultation.

V 1.7  13 Feb 2010
       Added actual data ranges for columns 214 - 268
       Col 20-25, and 233-238. Change specification fo unknown star - to give a value of 0.

V 1.6  10 Feb 2010
       Updated the list of datums, to accurately reflect the datum definitions used. [Also
        changed Col 27 as intended in the 9 Feb 2010 changes...]

V 1.5  9 Feb 2010
       Added ‘&lt&gt  not specified‘ to columns 27, 28, 34, 35, 37, 43, 54, 55, 60 and 62.
       Col 35. Added 'O  Other [details reported to ILOC, but not captured.]' to 
       Col 103-104, and 260-261. Replaced ‘&lt&gt not known’ with ‘0  not known’.
       Col 27. Adjusted the definition of a Miss event, to encompass how it has been used
        in the back-file.

V 1.4  1 June 2009
       Defined code field (70) to flag events where telescope details and observer names
        have been retrieved from original reports. This is associated with grazing occultations
        sourced from code H under column 72 (or derivatives), where the RGO data for
        the telescope details and observers had been lost. Copies of many of the
        reports were available, and were reviewed for this purpose. 

V 1.3 30 April 2009
       Defined code field (71) to flag events where a graze is observed at both limbs 

V 1.2  12 April 2009
       Refined the codes for source of observation, and duplicate observations (columns 72 and 73).
        Extra codes used to identify graze observations that are either duplicates, or are invalid
        observations

V 1.1  1 April 2009
       Initial codes for source of observation, and duplicate observations, added to columns 72 and 73.

V 1.0  1 September 2008
       Released
