<H1>Graphic of planets and their moons</H1>
<!-- Insert Header in above line -->
<P>
This plots the appearance of a planet (including the phase for Mercury, Venus and Mars), and the apparent orbits of satellites around a planet. The options available are:

<li>Select the Planet from the option buttons at top left. The default planet on first loading is Jupiter.
<li>Specify the date and time for the plot. The time is entered in decimal hours.
<li>To display an animation, specify the 'Plot duration' in days, and the 'Plot interval' in days.  
If the planet has Moons:
<li>select which label should be used for the moons. Either none, just the roman numeral moon number, or the number plus name.
<li>Select whether the orbits of the moons should be shown (in addition to the location of the satellite). That part of the orbit which is further away than the planet is drawn as a dashed line.
<li>The positions of the satellites are shown when the check box Show moons is marked (the default setting.) Clear the box to just show the orbits. 
<li>Indicate whether 'small moons' should be included. The moons treated as 'small moons' are:<ul>
<li>Jupiter - V to XVI
<li>Saturn - IX
<li>Uranus - VI to XV
<li>Neptune - II
<li>Pluto - II to V</ul></p>

<p>The scale of the plot can be varied using the slider. There are two check-boxes to change the scale by a factor of 10, or 1/10. The scale can be changed during an animation. A scale line is included on the plot.

<p>Every 14 years, Saturn's rings become edge-on. For some occurences there is a single passage through the ring plane (eg 2009, 2025) and other occurences there are 3 passages (eg 1979/80, 1995/96).At around these times there are periods when the side of the rings visible from the earth is the unilluminated side. When this occurs, the rings are shown in gray.

<h3>Animated GIF</h3>
The animation can be saved as an animated GIF file. The animation parameters are set under <I>with Prediction.... Animated-GIF settings</I>, and the file created using <I>with Prediction... Create animated-GIF</I>. Guidance on the issues with creating an animated GIF file are given <A href="Animated%20GIFs.htm" >here </a>
	

<h2>Planetary occultations</h2>
<p>Where a star is occulted by a planet or one of its moons, the display is varied in the following manner:
<li>You cannot select the planet;
<li>In the center of the plot, there is a representation of the Earth
<li>with animation, the Earth stays in the middle, and rotates according to the time. The planet and its satellites move across the screen.
<li><em>The initial plot shows the planet and its satellites as they appear in the sky</em>. The image of the 
Earth is drawn so that you can use it to estimate local circumstances. To achieve this, the continents are draw back-to-front. Think of the image as being based on a transparent earth, and you are looking at the planet in the sky through the Earth - with you viewing the part of the Earth facing the planet from its underside. In the image below ( relating to an occultation of a star by Mars, Phobos and Deimos), the continents displayed are north and south America. The brown lines indicate the portion of the Earth that is sunlit.</li>
<em>You can change the plot so that the Continents are drawn as if you are 
looking down on the Earth, using the menu item <strong>with Prediction... Plot 
with Earth 'correct'</strong></em>
<p><img src="2008Jan21Mars.png"><br>
<p>Note that for some events, the image scale may be such that the initial image of the Earth is VERY small. When this occurs, you just need to change the plot scale.




<h2>Animation suggestions</h2>
<p>The animation feature can be quite instructive. The following two suggestions illustrate what is possible:</p>
<p>Demonstrate the phases and size change of Venus:
<li>Set Planet to Venus, 
<li>set date to 2007 Jan 1
<li>set Plot duration to 1000 days, plot interval to 2 days
<li> set slider to middle, with neither scale change boxes checked.  Draw....</p>

<p>Demonstrate the outer moons of Jupiter:
<li>Set Planet to Jupiter, 
<li>set date to 2008 Jan 1
<li>set 'Plot duration' to 1000 days, 'plot interval' to 2 days
<li> set Labels to 'Number'
<li>check 'Display orbits'
<li>check 'Include small moons'
<li> set slider to the second mark from the left end. Check the 'x10' box.  Draw....</p>
