<H1>Get Gaia DR2 position from VizieR</H1>
<!-- Insert Header in above line -->
<P>This form is provided to obtain Gaia DR2 star positions for stars irrespective of magnitude. 
It is called from the Asteroid Observations editor.</P>



<p>Where the user has the star catalogue files Gaia14_DR2 or Gaia11_DR2, and the 
user retrieves a star position, occult will retrieve a Gaia DR2 position from 
those files - assuming the star is present in Gaia DR2 and the star's magnitude 
is brighter than the faint limit of these files (14 and 11 respectively)</p>
<p>This form allows the user to retrieve Gaia DR2 data irrespective of the 
star's magnitude. The form has the following appearance:</p>
<p><img align="middle" src="GetGaiaFromVizieR.PNG" alt=""></p>
<h2>Identifying the star</h2>
<p>The retrieval of the Gaia position is based on the star's coordinates There 
are two ways of specifying the coordinates:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Manually enter the coordinates in the RA and Dec boxes at the top-right 
	of the form; or</li>
	<li>retrieve coordinates from a local copy of UCAC4 or USNO-B1, using the 
	one and Sequence number fields at top left, and clicking the button 
	underneath</li>
</ol>
<p>When this form is activated from the Asteroid Observations Editor, the UCAC4 
or USNO-B1 fields are populated (when available) from the editor. </p>
<p>Where the star coordinates are specified using the star identification at top 
left, the coordinates specified for the search have had proper motion to 2015.5 
applied (2015.5 being the epoch of Gaia DR2). Ifyou are manually entering the 
star coordinates, you should try to ensure the coordinates you specify are for 
2015.5, and not 2000. </p>
<h2>Retrieving the Gaia DR2 coordinates</h2>
<p>To retrieve the Gaia DR2 coordinates, click the Get Gaia DR2... button at the 
top right. It will take several seconds or more to send the query to VizieR and 
retrieve the response. VizieR has 9 sites around the world, and you can select 
which site you want to use from the menu item <strong>Vizier site...</strong>. 
[However some VizieR sites do not have a full collection of catalogues.]</p>
<p>The search conducted by this form retrieves all stars within 4 arc sec of the 
specified position. This may result in more than one star being returned. Up to 
4 stars will be listed, sorted by distance from that position.</p>
<h2>Selecting the star</h2>
<p>If you have used a reliable source of the star's position to specify its 
coordinates at 2015.5, the relevant Gaia DR2 entry should be the first listed 
entry.</p>
<p>However you should scan through the list to make sure you have correctly 
specified the relevant star. Have particular regard to the magnitudes. Also, 
whether proper motion has been specified (a star with proper motion specified is 
more likely to be the relevant star than one with no proper motions). The 
character sequence <strong>NaN</strong> indicates no proper motion value.</p>
<p>To select a star, check the corresponding radio button to its left. The first 
radio button is fixed to 'none' - to provide an option where no coordinates are 
returned.</p>
<h2>Returning the star coordinates</h2>
<p>Once you have checked the relevant radio button, click Return selected star. 
You will be taken back to the Observations editor, where the star's position for 
the date of the event (corrected for proper motion and parallax) will be 
displayed.</p>
