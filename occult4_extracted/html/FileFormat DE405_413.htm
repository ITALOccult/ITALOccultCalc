<P>Occult can use the JPL Development Ephemerides to compute the positions of the Planets, Occult will handle two versions:<ul>
<li>JPL_DE405.dat, which is the distributed version of the DE405 ephemeris (with a slightly different name), which 
covers the period 1600 to 2201.<br><br>
<li>DE405_413.bin. This file is a merged version of DE413 and DE405. DE413 was created in Nov. 2004 to improve the ephemeris of Pluto, and covers the period 1900 to 2050. The merged file covers the period 1600 to 2201 on the basis of DE405, with 1900 to 2050 being DE413. This file has been subsequently updated with morte recent versions of the DE ephemeris<br><br>
<li>DE_6000yrs.bin. This file is the DE422 ephemeris, created in 2010. It covcers the 6000 year period from -3000 to +3000. The download is a huge 550MB....<br><br>

When creating the merged file, the opportunity was taken to change the data format from big-endian to little-endian.</ul></P>

An explanation of the various versions of the DE Ephemeris series is provided <A  href="JPL_DE.htm"> here</a>.

<p>The preferred ephemeris is the DE405_413 ephemeris. The DE405 ephemeris will only be used if it was available in a previous installation of Occult.</p>
