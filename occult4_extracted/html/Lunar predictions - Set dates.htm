<H1>Set UT dates for the predictions</H1>
<p align=center><img src="SetUTDates.png">
<p>Setting dates is  one of the most fundamental issues with generating predictions. In 
Occult, there are two basic approaches to setting dates:<ul>
<li>set a date range, to generate predictions covering a range of dates. Such predictions would be used to publish predictions, and to identify future events to observe (that is, forward planning). 
<li>generate predictions for a particular day. This might be for forward planning, or for observing events 'today'.</ul>
<p>Note that many of the advanced features for occultation predictions are only available for predictions generated for a single day. </p>

<h3><br>Setting the date</h3>
<P>In box 4 you set the date range for the predictions. Particular issues are:<ul>
<li>Whenever you change the Start date, the End date will be reset to be the same as the start date
<li> the 'Year' button sets the start date to January first, and the end date to December 31 - for the year set in the Start date line.
<li> the 'Month' button sets the start date to the first day of the month, and the end date to the 31 day of the month - for the year and month set in the Start date line. [If the month has less than 31 days, the actual end date of the predictions will be the 1st day of the following month; for February it will be March 2 or 3]. 
<li> the 'Day' button sets the end date to being the same as the displayed start date.
<li> the 'Today' button sets the start and end date to being the UT date corresponding to the  date, time, and time zone in the computer's 
system clock. [As a result, the date inserted here can at times be the day before or after the local date.]</ul>
</P>

<h3><br>IMPORTANT  - Setting the 'Starting at ' value </h3>
<p>Occult generates predictions using a time window of 24 hours - identifying all geocentric conjunctions that occur in the window, and then generating local predictions. Inevitably, near the start and end of a 24hr period there are events that fall within the preceding/following day.<p>
<p>The natural observing period is night-time. Accordingly, to minimise issues with the 'end' of the 24hr computing period, the computing period needs to run from about mid-day to mid-day. The 'Starting at' column of radio buttons is provided for this purpose.</p>

<p>The setting on the prediction form is retained between sessions. It is initially set when you first installed Occult4 - provided you specified your site longitude in the first box on the User Settings page. [Note: It will be reset whenever you change the site longitude on the User Settings page.] </p>

<p>The following table provides a guide to which setting to use for different regions of the world, to ensure the start and end of the computation day occurs within about 3 hours of local midday.
