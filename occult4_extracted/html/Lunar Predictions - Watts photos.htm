<h3>Example</h3>
<img src="WattsPhotos.png">

<P>At the top of this form, you can adjust the libration values used for the plots. When this form is opened, the librations will have been set to those 
applying at the location where the form was called from (e.g. a graze profile).

<p>The top part of the form is a simple plot of the profile from the Watts charts. The check box allows you to selectively apply the Appleby & Morrison corrections to the profile.

<p>The bottom part of the form is a plot of the librations of all the photographs used to generate the watts chart at this particular Axis Angle. Each blue dot represents an individual photograph. The red circle indicates the location of the current libration combination. If the red circle is relatively close to blue dots, the implication is that the Watts profile for the location of the red circle will not have involved much interpolation or extrapolation and should be fairly reliable. However if the red circle is in a region where there are not many blue dots, the accuracy may be reduced. And if the red circle is well outside the region covered by the blue dots, the profile may be quite unreliable.
