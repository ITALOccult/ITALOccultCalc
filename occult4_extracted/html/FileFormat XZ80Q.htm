<H1><A NAME="idh_4overview"></A>XZ80 star catalogue</H1>
<P> XZ80 is the main catalogue used for predicting lunar occultations. It is based on the XZ80Q catalogue, which is archived in the Vizier system, at:<BR>
<A HREF="http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?xz80Q" target=_blank> XZ80Q catalogue</A>
<BR><P>
<P>The format of the star catalogues used in OCCULT is a 35-byte record length random-access file. The main file (XZ80.dat) is the XZ80Q catalogue. This is an expansion of the XZ80P catalogue based on the Tycho-2 catalogue, and includes all stars in Tycho-2 to Visual magnitude 12.0. There are 186798 stars in XZ80Q, with numbers ranged between 1 and 187172.<BR><BR>

The first record contains the first and last star number in the file. This record is in ASCII, with the two numbers separated by a carriage return. The location of the carriage return is not fixed..<BR><BR>

All subsequent records contain the following information:<BR>

The double star code has the following definitions:
<UL>C = double, component in XZ80Q, Separation <1"<BR>
c = double, component not in XZ80Q, Separation <1"<BR>
D = double, component in XZ80Q, Separation <10"<BR>
d = Double, component not in XZ80Q, Separation <10"<BR>
W = double, component in XZ80Q, Separation >10"<BR>
w = double, component not in XZ80Q, Separation >10"<BR>
M = multiple system, all components in XZ80Q<BR>
S = multiple system, some but not all in XZ80Q<br>
K = star in K2 catalogue, short cadence<br>
k = star in K2 catalogue, long cadence<br>
P = star in K2 catalogue, short cadence, and one of the other double star flags apply<br>
p = star in K2 catalogue, long cadence, and one of the other double star flags apply<br>
The K, k, P, p codes have precedence over the other codes.</ul>
The variable star code has the following definitions:<BR>
<UL>E = eclipsing-type variable, magnitude variation >0.5 mag<BR>
e = eclipsing-type variable, magnitude variation <0.5 mag<BR>
V = other variable, magnitude variation >0.5 mag<BR>
v = other variable, magnitude variation <0.5 mag<BR>
S = suspected variable, magnitude variation >0.5 mag<BR>
s = suspected variable, magnitude variation <0.5 mag</UL><BR>

The XZ80 catalogue has an associated <B>.inx</B> file. This file is a random access file of record length 9, containing 361 records. Each record corresponds to a 1-degree (4 min) increment in R.A., for 0 deg through to 360 degrees. The record contains the record number (in ASCII) /in the catalogue file of the first star whose RA is greater than or equal to the relevant increment in RA.
