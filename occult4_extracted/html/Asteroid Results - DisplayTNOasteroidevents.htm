<H1>Events involving distant asteroids</H1>
<P>This list is provided to help identify observed occultations involving distant asteroids.

<p>The criterion that is applied is the heliocentric distance of the asteroid at the time of the occultation.  
The criterion for inclusion is a heliocentric distance greater than 4 AU - which is at the outer edge of the main asteroid belt - but inside the orbit of Jupiter.

<p>The list can be sorted by heliocentric distance, asteroid name or number, or event date.

<p>When analysing the list, remember that some asteroids move in quite eccentric orbits, and as a result can appear in the list at quite different heliocentric distances. For example, the asteroid 2060 has entries at 9.0 and 12.0 AU.
