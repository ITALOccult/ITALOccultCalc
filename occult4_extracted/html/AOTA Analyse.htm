<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Methodology<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
detailed analysis of an event involves the fitting of a theoretical transition
light curve to each of the transitions (the D and R events). Each transition is
analysed separately. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>The theoretical transition signals are based on a uniform light level before
and after the transition, and a transition region of variable length. The
transition region is calculated on the basis of the effects of stellar
diameter. The effects of Fresnel diffraction are not included. </p>

<p>The default number of transition lengths that are investigated is 10.
However the number can be varied between 5 and 30, using the <span
class=SpellE>UpDown</span> box '# transitions'. The actual value used is
non-critical - however the response time will increase when the number of
transitions is large. </p>

<p>The analysis requires an identified region <span class=SpellE>centered</span>
on the transition - which is where the detailed comparison of the light curves <span
class=GramE>occur</span>, and a region on either side to set the
characteristics (mean and standard deviation) of the pre-and post-transition
signals. These regions are coloured light yellow and light blue on the plot. </p>

<p>The analysis proceeds by comparing the theoretical transition signal for a
given transition length with the observed signal and generated a &#967;<sup>2</sup>
statistic for each positioning of the theoretical signal along the measurement
region of the observed signal. In this process the overall position of the
theoretical signal remains fixed with respect to the observed signal; the
variation is achieved by changing the positioning of the transition within the
theoretical signal. The theoretical signal covers both the measurement region
and the two regions on either side. However the transition region is moved only
across the range of the measurement region. </p>

<p>The event time is identified with the location that has the minimum &#967;<sup>2</sup>
value. That value can be different for different length transitions. The
uncertainties in the event times are estimated by way of a Monte Carlo analysis
- on the basis of a user-selected transition length. The process involves:</p>

<p>When the tab is entered from the previous step, the various regions required
for the analysis are pre-set using default values. <i><span style='color:red'>These
values should be reviewed.</span></i> The mean and standard deviations derived
from the settings can be displayed on the plot by checking the Show measurement
means checkbox in the <span class=SpellE>center</span> of the form (see figure
below under <span class=GramE><b><i>The</i></b></span><b><i> initial analysis,
and plot information</i></b>). The following plot shows the means (black line)
and standard deviations (dashed green line at no occultation, dashed purple
line during occultation) in the three circled areas. <span style='mso-no-proof:
yes'><img border=0 width=663 height=213 id="_x0000_i1037"
src="AOTA_AnalysisWithAverages.png"></span></p>

<p>During this part of the analysis, it is usually helpful to increase the plot
scale - to 5 or 10 - so that you can view the detail of the transition region.
[The program will automatically increase the plot scale when this tab is
entered.] </p>

<p>The regions are identified with Yellow for the measurement region, and light
blue for the before/after regions. Data points within those regions now have
associated uncertainty bars - being derived from the standard deviation of the
data points in the before/after regions. </p>

<p>Typically the uncertainty bars are smaller at the bottom of a light curve
that at the top. By default the error bars are proportioned according to the <b><i>Variance
</i></b>of the signals before and after the transition. However this may be
changed to being proportioned according to <b><i>standard deviation </i></b>by
checking the box '<b>Vary noise by <span class=GramE>Std</span> <span
class=SpellE>Devn</span></b>'. </p>

<p>Setting the regions incorrectly can have significant adverse effects on the
analysis. The principles to follow are:</p>

<p>The extent of the side regions is adjusted using the 'Points outside of

This can be adjusted to being between 5 and 40. </p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Settings related to
the &#967;<sup>2</sup> analysis<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-no-proof:yes'><img border=0 width=167 height=70 id="_x0000_i1036"

<p>The program fits multiple theoretical light curves to the observed light
curve - differing by the duration (frames) over which the occultation
transition occurs. The default setting is for 10 frames (plot points). However
this can be adjusted to being between 5 and 30 frames (plot points) using the
'# transitions' <span class=SpellE>UpDown</span> box in the &#967;<sup>2</sup>
analysis group. </p>

<p>In a typical occultation light curve, the noise at the bottom of the light
curve is less than that at the top. For the &#967;<sup>2</sup> analysis the
noise needs to be appropriate to the signal level of each data point - which
requires interpolating/extrapolating the noise level dependent upon the height
of the data point. The default method for doing this is to linearly
interpolate/extrapolate the noise on the basis of its Variance (variance is the
square of the standard deviation). Checking the radio button 'Vary noise by <span
class=GramE>Std</span> <span class=SpellE>Devn</span>' will linearly
interpolate/extrapolate the noise on the basis of its Standard Deviation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
uncertainty in the event time is estimated using a Monte Carlo analysis. The
process involves taking the original signal (either the observed signal, or the
trial signal), adding noise, and computing the event time for that
noise-affected situation. This process is repeated a large number of times
(trials) to obtain a statistically reliable indication of the range of possible
solutions given the level of noise present. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>The number of trials that are conducted is set by the <span class=SpellE>UpDown</span>
box '# Monte Carlo trials' in the Monte Carlo Parameters group. The default
setting is 200, but this can be changed to between 100 and 2000. Note that when
the number of trial is large, the program responsiveness becomes slow. </p>

</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
default setting is to apply the noise to the test signal. This can be changed

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
noise signal that is added uses a random number generator with a normal
distribution. [The algorithm used is the <b>Box-Muller </b>algorithm]. This
will generate numbers that potentially are many standard deviations away from
the mean. Large noise deviations can be excluded from the noise applied in the
Monte Carlo analysis by adjusting the setting in the <span class=SpellE>UpDown</span>
box labelled <b>Std Dev limit on noise</b>' in the Monte Carlo Parameters
group. The default setting is 3; it can be varied between 2 and 4. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>The distribution of the possible event times appear to frequently have
significant differences associated with whether the Monte Carlo noise is added
to the observed signal or the test signal. <i>It is believed that the results
obtained when adding the noise to the test signal are more reliable.</i> </p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Interpretation of
the &#967;<sup>2</sup> curve<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
plot includes a plot of the &#967;<sup>2</sup> curve corresponding to the
selected slope. That curve is a plot of the &#967;<sup>2</sup> value for
different positions of the test light signal along the transition region of the
observed light signal. You can also plot the &#967;<sup>2</sup> curve for all
transition lengths considered, by clicking the <b>ALL </b>region of the &#967;<sup>2</sup>
bars. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>If the event is well defined (with an expectation that the uncertainty will
be small), the &#967;<sup>2</sup> curve will be v-shaped with a narrow bottom,
as in the following plot which shows the &#967;<sup>2</sup> curves for a series
of transition slopes. This example also shows a situation where the event time
is largely independent of the selected transition slope (the event time being
located at the bottom of the series of &#967;<sup>2</sup> curves for different
slopes.) </p>

<p><span style='mso-no-proof:yes'><img border=0 width=167 height=308
id="_x0000_i1033" src="AOTA_chi2Def.png"></span></p>

<p>Sometimes the event is well defined on one side, but less certain on the
other - leading to a &#967;<sup>2</sup> curve that is steep on one side, and
shallow on the other - as in the following example. This example also shows a
situation where the event time depends upon the selected transition slope (the
event time being located at the bottom of the series of &#967;<sup>2</sup>
curves for different slopes.) In these situations you can expect the
uncertainty in the event time to be asymmetric. That is, the plus and minus
uncertainty values will usually be different. </p>

<p><span style='mso-no-proof:yes'><img border=0 width=201 height=304
id="_x0000_i1032" src="AOTA_Chi2indef.png"></span></p>

<p>Sometimes the event is poorly defined, with the &#967;<sup>2</sup> curve
being broad with no well-defined bottom point, as in the following example. In
such cases the uncertainty values are likely to be relatively large, with there
being a real possibility that the 'event' was not an occultation. Indeed, the
cross-correlation plot should be carefully reviewed to be satisfied the event
was in fact an occultation. </p>

<p>An extreme example is the following from a light drop caused by cloud. The
10 &#967;<sup>2</sup> curves that are plotted are very flat and virtually
overlie each other. Events having these characteristics should be disregarded! </p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Interpreting the
uncertainty range plot<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
plot of the uncertainty range is a bar-chart plot of the distribution of
results from the Monte Carlo analysis. The sum height of all the bars equals
the height of the plot. When an event is very well defined, the plot will show
a single bar, with perhaps a very small adjacent bar. Frequently the event will
be well defined but 'between' two frames - resulting in two adjacent bars of
similar height. These two situations are shown in the R and D plots
(respectively) in the following: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-no-proof:yes'><img border=0 width=204 height=141
id="_x0000_i1029" src="AOTA_UncertaintyEx1.png"></span></p>

<p>When an event is poorly defined, the plot will have numerous bars spread
across the plot. When there is a column at the left or right end of the plot
(as in the D example in the next plot), you can assume that the event is quite
unreliable. </p>

<p>Sometimes the observation is such that there is more than one possible
solution. This will be evidenced by two (or more) groups of bars with gaps
between the groups - as in the Reappearance example in the following plot.
These situations require careful inspection to be sure the possibilities are real.
However note that it would be erroneous to try to prevent the situation by
'judicious' setting the measurement regions to avoid 'inconvenient' parts of
the light curve! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The

<p>The Uncertainty is calculated on the basis of the Monte Carlo trials. That
is, with a level of confidence set at 90%, 90% of the Monte Carlo trials result
in an event time that is within the uncertainty limits. </p>

<p>There may be circumstances where the user believes the uncertainty range is
too broad in the circumstances. A smaller uncertainty range can be generated by
changing the level of confidence:</p>

<p>Separate levels of confidence are available for both the D and R events. The
levels of confidence used will be included in the report generated by AOTA. </p>

<p><span class=GramE>As a general principle, reducing the level of confidence
in order to reduce the uncertainties in the event time is not appropriate.</span>
Where a level of confidence less than 90% is used in the analysis, this fact
should be included in the report of the observations. </p>

affected by the presence of an anomalous data point near the event. When such a

small uncertainty. This is illustrated in the following example. The data point
at frame 596 is very low compared to the data points on either side, but

the AOTA plot.] This will set the data point as being invalid - appearing as a

repeating the CTRL + Right-Click. </p>
