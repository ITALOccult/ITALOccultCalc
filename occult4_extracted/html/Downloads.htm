The <B>Downloads </B>form (under Maintenance, Downloads), provides a single location for downloading various files that require updating from time to time.

<p>The downloads are split into 3 groups, as follows:

<h3>General downloads</h3>
<p>The files in this group should be regularly updated. They are all relatively small files.
<p>IMPORTANT. For the accurate reduction of lunar occultations, the EOP 1962 to present file should be updated on a weekly basis.

<h3>Files for asteroid predictions</h3>
<p>The files in this group specifically relate to predicting asteroid occultations. The Steve Preston files are fairly small. Astorb and MPCOrb are about 30MB downloads. 

<h3>Static data files</h3>
<p>This final group is for files that are rarely updated. These downloads are only required if there is advice issued to download these files. The Historical files of lunar occultations is about 30MB, Tycho2 and JPL are both over 50MB. The EOP file is relatively small.

<h2>Indicators for when to download</h2>
At the left of the form a date is displayed (two dates for deltaT). This date is the file date of the current version of that file on your computer.  If the file does not exist, the dsate will be shown as '-- --- ----'. For the majority of files, the need to download is apparent from the use you are making of the data. 

<p>The Static data files will not require updating very often (perhaps many years). For the Historical lunar observations, the XZ catalogue, the Tycho2 catalogue, and the JPL planetary ephemeris, a check will be done each time the download form is opened of whether there is a new version of any of these files. If there is, a double chevron '>>' will appear to the left of the download button to indicate that a download is required. 
[Note: some firewalls involve a delay in making a download connection - in which case there will be a delay in opening the form.] 

<h2>Control issues</h2>
To maintain the accuracy of Occult, regular updating of data files is important. To this end, the code provides as follows:

<ul type=1><li>If the download form has not been opened for 30 days, it will be opened when Occult starts. [The 30 day period can be changed in the User Settings, Internet and FTP group]
<li>For new users, the download form is the tool to download the large data files that Occult uses - and users will be advised of the need to download or update when they first run Occult.
<li>When the download form loads, it will only download the file for advising of updates to the large files if the current file is more than 10 days old.
