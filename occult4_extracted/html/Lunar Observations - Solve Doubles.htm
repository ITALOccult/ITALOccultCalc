<H1>Determine Separation and PA of doubles from Lunar Occultations</H1>

<P>This form provides for a least-squares solution to determine the position angle and separation of the components of a double star, using two or more observations.

<p>While it would be desirable to use observations made on the same night, you can use observations from different lunations, or even differnt years - provided the double star is not changing rapidly .</P>

<p align=center><img src= "Lunar%20Observations%20-%20Double%20star%20solution.png">

<p>The <B>Event </B>box at the top of the form is for the star identification, and date of observation. This is used to form the file name, and to identify the event. This data is only sued to identify the file; it is not used in the analysis in any way.
<li><B>Year</B>- a year - used for file name.
<li><B>Mth </B>- a month.....
<li><B>Day</B>- a day....
<li><B>Star ID</B>- the star identifier.<br><br>

<p>This box also provides links to the WDS catalogue, and the 4th Interferometric Catalogue. Additionally, to assist with preparing papers for publication, the List Equivalents button is provided  - to list the star identification in a range of other catalogues.
 
<p>The <B>Details of an observation </B>box is an area to enter or edit the details for an observation The data falls into 5 groups, as follows:
<ul>
<b>Data  relating to the double star observation</b>
<li><B>T1 </B>- the seconds of the event involving the brighter star. Avoid having a negative value;
<li><B>T2 </B>- the seconds of the event involving the fainter star. Make sure the seconds are referenced to the same minute as used for T1. Negative values are allowed, but the reference minut must be the same as for the primary star;
<li>the button <b>Swap T1, T2</b> allows the user to swap the T1 & T2 times. The need for this might arise from incorrect data entry. However when the stars involved are of similar brightness it may be necessary to swap the times for some observers in order to have consistence in the star which is being treated as the primary star.
<li><B>PA </B>- the observed PA of the event (in degrees). Preferably obtained from a double star report. However it can be taken from the reduction of an observation or the lunar archive. 
<li><B>rv </B>- the radial motion of the moon (arcsecs/second). Preferably obtained from a double star report. However it can be taken from the predictions.
<li><B>cct </B>- the angle between the normal to the lunar surface, and the moon's motion (in degrees). Preferably obtained from a double star report. However it can be extract from the predictions. 
<li><B>Scale</b> - the ratio of the apparent lunar diameter to the mean lunar diameter. Preferably obtained from a double star report. However it can be extracted from reductions, or the lunar archive.
<li><b>limb slope</b> - the slope of the lunar limb relative to the horizontal.  If the user has the LOLA lunar limb installed, this field will be automatically completed during the solution. Otherwise the user will need to manually fill this field - as detailed below.<br><br>


<b>Date of observation, and Observer</b>
<br>This data is used to identify the specific observation, but is otherwsie not used in the solution.
<li><B>Year</B>- the year of the particular observation.
<li><B>Mth </B>- the month of the particular observation.
<li><B>Day</B>- the day of the particular observation.
<li><B>Observer </B>- the observer's name.<br><br>

<b>Librations, to determine the limb slope</b>
<li><b>l</b> - Longitude libration
<li><b>b</b> - Latitude libration
<li><b>AA</b> - Axis angle at the event.<br><br>

<b>Circumstances relevant to assessing reliability</B>
<li><b>CA</b> - Cusp Angle
<li><b>%Illum</b> - % illumination
<li><b>Alt</b> - Altitude of moon
</ul>

<H2>Entering observations</H2>
There are two  preferred modes of entering observations. The first is to read one or more double star report files generated by Occult. The 2nd is to paste the data from a report generated by Occult. Alternatively the data can be manually added.

<h3>Reading double star report files</h3>
Select this option (either from the menu under <B>Files</B>, or using the button <B>Read observation file(s)</B>, and navigate to the folder where one or more double star report files are held. Select all the files to read. The files will all be read, with the data being placed in the Observatiuons box at the bottom of the form. The first event is used to populate the star ID and date the <B>Event </B>box. At the completion, it may benecessary to add the local limb slope for each event if the LOLA lunar limb has not been installed - see below.

<h3>Pasting the data</h3>
Merely copy (CTRL-C) the entire content of the email report, then click <B>Paste an observation</B>. If it is the first event, the star ID and date will be populated in the <B>Event </B>box. If it is a subsequent event, an alert will be raised if the star number does not correspond with the star number displayed on the form. Additionally, the lunar limb for the location of the event will be displayed - see below. 

<h3>Manual entry</h3>
If needed, the <B>Details </B>of an observation can be entered manually. The limb slope is added - see immediately following.

<H3>Setting the local limb slope</h3>
If the LOLA lunar limb has been downloaded, this field will be automatically set duriung the solution process - and re-evaluated whenever the double star solution changes.
<br>If a double star report does not include any of the librations l, b, AA, or the scale, the program will attempt to retrieve these values for the event from the Lunar Archive. If the event cannot be found in eth Lunar Archive, the event will be unchecked to exlude it from the analysis. In this siutation it is appropriate to confirm that ou have correctly specified the date, star number, and the observer's family name. The event can be included by checking the box; however the limb slope will likley be incorrect - resulting in a poor solution.

<p>Otherwise the slope of the lunar limb needs to be manually included to allow a proper analysis of the observations. This is done by plotting the event location against the lunar limb, and drawing a line that is tangential to the limb. If the event is pasted, the limb is automatically plotted. Otherwise the limb for the currently displayed event is generated by clicking <B><I>Review limb slope</I></B>. 

<p>The lunar limb plot will include two vertical lines near the center. The lines are located approximately 2" of arc on either side of the event [The 2" displayed is based on the mean radius of the moon, not the actual radius at the time of the event.] 

<p>To obtain the limb slop from the limb plot, place the mouse on the profile at a point of interest, holding down the left mouse button, and drawing a line parallel to the limb. Next to the cursor the slope of the limb will be displayed. When the left-button is released, the last-measured slope is written just above the plot area, to the right.  Enter the displayed value (<B><I>including the sign</I></B>) into the 'limb slope' box. Then click either <B>Add </B>or <B>Replace</B>, depending on whether the limb slope is being incorporated into a new observation entry, or is being added to an existing observation entry.

<H2>Editing observations</H2>
To edit an observation - select the observations from the list of observations using the up/down cursor keys. Make the required changes in the <B>Details of an observation </B>area.  Then click <B>Replace</B>.

<p>To Delete an observation - select the observations from the list of observations using the up/down cursor keys, so that it is listed in the <B>Details of an observation </B>area.  Then click <B>Delete</B>. You will be asked to confirm.



<H2>Plot and Solution</h2>
Generally the observations are plotted, and a solution is generated, whenever data in the list of observations is changed. A solution can be 'forced' by clicking the <B>Plot </B>button.

<p>Providing the Lola lunar limb has been downloaded, the solution is an iterative process. The first iteration simply assumes a smooth lunar limb to generate an initial solution for the separation and PA. Thereafter the speration and PA are used to determine the limb height at the location of the secondary star (with allowance for the curvature of the limb) to generate a new solution. This last step is repeated a 2nd time to generate the final solution.

<h3>The Limb Plot</h3>
All checked observations are plotted in the Limb Plot. The limbs are plotted relative to the central 'bright' star, at a location corresponding to when the limb occulted the secondary star. The limbs are drawn as straight lines, and do not show the lunar topography. However provided the Lola lunar limb has been downloaded, their location closest to the secondary star as shown in the plot is accurately positioned having regard to the lunar profile. This results in the secondary star being located at the point of intersection of the limb lines. [This is on the assumption that that the brighter and fainter star have been correctly identified in the report. Also, if the observations are on different dates, the possibility of motion of the companion must be considered.]
<p>The Limbs are colour coded, and have a number plotted at the location closest to the central star. A legend is provided which gives the colour coding, the reference number, the T1 value, and the observer's name. The legend includes all events - not just those plotted.
<p>The plot can include an indication of the uncertainty associated with the positions of the limb lines - by checking the checkbox <B>Plot nominal uncertainties</B>. The uncertainty region is indicated on the basis of an uncertainty of &#177 half a video frame for both the primary and secondary star (a combined total of 0.7 frames), and a frame rate intermediate between PAL and NTSC. That is the uncertainty is indicated as the displacement of &#177 0.025 secs in the location of each limb.  [For older observations made visually, the check box <B>Visual uncerts</B> increases the uncertainty displacement to &#177 0.10secs.] The plot above displays as:
<p align=center><img src= "Lunar%20Observations%20-%20Double%20star%20solution_Errors.png">
<p>A good solution will have the bands overlapping at the location of the scondary star. When a band is located some distance from the secondary star, consideration should be given to whether that observation should be excluded from the solution. For example, chord #8 (the orange limb) in:
<p align=center><img src= "Lunar%20Observations%20-%20Double%20star%20solution_R2366.png">
<p>However in such situations it is appropriate to consider whether there has been an obvious reporting error that can be recitified. In this case, it seems likely that the reported time for the secondary should have been 10.5 sec rather than 12.5 secs - which might be explained by a transcription error from a hand-written report (the event was in 1991).

<p>The scale of the plot can be varied using the slider to the left of the plot. The scale can also be increased by a factor of five by checking the box at the top-left of the plot. The location of the stars within the plot area can be adjusted using the scroll-bars at the bottom and right of the plot area.
<p>The plot can be drawn either in color or B&W with the menu item with <B>Observations</B>... <B>Plot in B&W</B>



<h3>The solution</h3> 
<p>The solution is based on those observations that are checked in the list. At least two observations must be checked to generate a solution. Three or more observations are required for a least-squares best fit. The best solution will come from events that have a significant difference in PA of the event. Occultations results made on different dates can be used on an assumption that there has been little change in the separation and PA over the period. However in these circumstances the user MUST be careful to verify the validity of this assumption, and/or qualify the derived PA and separation as being subject to this assumption.

<p>The &#177  values are based on the consistency of the fit. The degree of convergance of the limbs in the plot is a good indicator of consistency. It will also identify anomalous observations. To ascertain the effect of uncertainties in the observed time difference (which is required if there are only a small number of observations), change the times by the estimated uncertainty, and note the change in the solution values.

<p>Under some circumstances the solution might not converge. The code allows for 100 iterations. If the solution has not converged, the RMS value will be followed by the words ' Invalid solution'.
