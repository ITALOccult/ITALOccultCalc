<h1>Overview of the prediction process</h1>
<P>An asteroidal occultation consists of a path across the Earth having a width 
equal to the diameter of the asteroid. That is, the width of the path is only a 
fraction of the Earth's diameter. Furthermore, some of the path may be in 
locations which are sunlit at the time of the occultation, and/or may be in 
locations which are relatively inaccessible.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Occult generates predictions in a two-stage 
process. </P>
<h4>Stage 1 is</h4>
<ul>
	<li>specify the asteroid or asteroids to be considered in the search;</li>
	<li>select the star catalogue to be used in the search;</li>
	<li>set the start and end of the period to be covered by the search; and</li>
	<li>generate a set of Besselian elements for all events where an edge of the 
	occultation path comes within a specified distance of the Earth's center 
	(default distance is 1.01 Earth radius - with allowance for the effects of 
	stellar diameter being incorporated where appropriate).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Help</em> topic for Stage 1 is
<a href="#14/Help/html/Asteroid predictions - Search.htm">here</a></p>
<h4>Stage 2 is</h4>
<ul>
	<li>filter the list of events to those that are of potential 
	interest. Those filters include parameters like solar elongation, local 
	altitude, minimum duration, minimum magnitude drop, faintest star magnitude, 
	and distance relevant to the observer's location.</li>
	<li>save the list of events for future reference</li>
	<li>create a 'personal feed' for Occult Watcher</li>
	<li>sort the events according to a range of parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>At any stage, selected events can be displayed, with a wide range of related 
information being accessible.</p>

<H1>Demonstration of Asteroid predictions</H1>

<p>Generating predictions of asteroid or planet occultations is a three-step process<ul type=1>
<li>ensure you have a current set of orbital elements for asteroids
<li>compare the position of the asteroid or planet with a star catalogue to 
generate a list of global;
<li>filter the events using a range of selection criteria to create a list of predictions 
of interest to you.</ul>

<B><p><B>NOTE:</B> <span class="auto-style1">The initial installation of </span>Occult<span class="auto-style1"> does not include any 
catalogues suitable for Asteroid predictions. Three relevant star catalogues can 
be downloaded from the </span>Downloads<span class="auto-style1"> form of </span>Occult:
<ul>
	<li>Tycho2 
(pre Gaia) (#32) <span class="auto-style1"><em>[ a 64MB download]</em></span>,
	</li>
	<li>Gaia11_DR2 (#41)<span class="auto-style1"> <em>[ a 70MB download<B>] </B>
	</em>and </span></li>
	<li>Gaia14_DR2 (#40) <B><span class="auto-style1"><em>[ a 847MB download]</em></span></B>.
	</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="auto-style1">Occult can also use <strong>UCAC4</strong>, <strong>UCAC5</strong> &amp; 
<strong>PPMXL</strong> - which need to be 
sourced elsewhere. This example assumes you have downloaded the </span>Tycho2 
(preGaia)
</B>
catalogue 
(download option <strong>#32</strong>).
</p>
<h2>Step 1 - Create a current set of orbital elements</h2>
<ul type=1>
<li>Select the <B>Maintenance </B>tab, and click the <B>General downloads </B>
button to open the Downloads form.<li>Make sure you are internet connected.
	<li>The preferred source of elements is <strong>MPCORB</strong>. However we 
	want to have <strong>Astorb</strong> available as it contains error 
	estimates that are not present in <strong>MPCORB</strong> or <strong>
	AstDyS-2.</strong><li>The conversion process also makes use of information 
	contained in the files relating to <strong>Binary Asteroids</strong> 
	(download <strong>#6</strong>), <strong>Asteroid Rings</strong> (Download<strong> 
	#7</strong>), <strong>Asteroid Diameters</strong> (download <strong>#8</strong>) 
	and <strong>Asteroid Classes</strong> (download <strong>#9</strong>). You 
	should ensure these files are up-to-date<li>Under <B>Files for Asteroid Predictions</B>, click the <B>Download</B> button next to <B>Astorb 
	(option #24)</B>. 
<li>After a few seconds, a progress bar will appear showing download status. If you cannot connect to 
<strong>Astorb</strong>, try clicking the adjacent button for the VizieR Mirror 
(option 24a).
<li>When the download completes, click <B>OK </B>in the confirmation box.  The file will be unzipped, and then a conversion form containing three boxes will automatically open. 
We do not want to convert <strong>Astorb</strong> at this time - so simply close 
this form.<li>The downloads form should still be open. Click the <B>Download</B> button next to 
	<B>MPCORB (option #22)</B> - which is the file we want to use 
	<li>When the download completes, the conversion form containing three boxes will automatically open. 
	<li>In box <B>1 Select File</B>, check <strong>MPCORB</strong>.
	It should be pre-checked) 
	<li>In box <B>2 Set selection criteria</B>, set the diameter to 15 km, and check the 
	<B>Numbered minor planets only </B>check box.<li>Box<B> 3 Specify 
	'mandatory' minor planets</B> has several asteroids listed. 
Do not make any changes here at this time. But if later you want to generate predictions of a particular small asteroid, you can enter the number here to make sure the asteroid is included in the file.
	<li>Click <strong>Convert</strong>. A file dialogue box will appear. It should show the file 
	<em>MPCORB.dat</em> in the directory Downloaded Files. In the <B>Name </B>section of the dialog, double-click 
	<em>MPCORB.dat</em>. The conversion will now take place.
	<li>Click <B>OK </B>in the confirmation box.
	<li>Close the <B>Downloads </B>form.</ul>
<p>You now have a file of asteroid elements that can be used to search for 
occultation events. That file is located in the <em>Occult 4\Resource Files\</em> 
directory with the name<em> AsteroidElements.csv</em>. The format is described
<a href="#14/Help/html/FileFormat AsteroidElements.htm">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 2 - Search for occultation events</h2>
<ul type=1>
<li>On the Occult Main Menu, select the <B>Asteroid predictions </B>tab, and click the <B>Search for, 
&amp; list, occultations </B>button.
<li>In box <B>1 set the date range for the Search</B>, click the button for <B>2018</B>. [If you are doing this after 2018, set the date range to cover all of 2018].
<li>In box <b>2</b>, <b>set the search for Minor Planets</b>.
	<li>In box <B>3 Select star catalogue for search</B>, <br>* select the <B>Tycho2 
	(pre Gaia) </B>catalogue:<br>* Leave the three check boxes at the bottom of 
	box 3 unchecked.
<li>In box <B>4 Select the minor planets for the search</B>, click the <B>Set range of minor planets </B>
button. In the form that appears, read the text. But click OK without entering anything into the text field.
<li>In the list of asteroids that now appears, highlight asteroids 1 through to 30. Then click the <B>OK</B> button at the bottom of the screen. Note how the range of selected 
asteroids is now indicated on the search form next to the <B>Set range of minor planets </B>button.
	<li>Repeat step 5, but this time enter <strong>-40</strong> into the text 
	field in the form that appears. Note how the range is now set to cover the 
	asteroids 1 to 40.<li>Ensure the diameter in the line for <B>Exclude minor planets smaller than  </B>is set to 15 km. The check box for <B>User file of elements </B>
should be clear. The drop-down box labeled 'Limit search to' should be set to
<strong>All </strong>(this box limits a search based on taxonomy). The check box 
to <strong>Exclude if duration less than</strong> should be checked, with a 
value of 2 secs being a reasonable value.<li>Box <B>5</B> is only enabled when the asteroid is known to have one or more moons with known orbits. If this box is enabled, read the Help topic for the Search form to learn how to use this box.
<li>In the group of boxes at the bottom of the form, the button for <B>1995 Oct 10 == 2023 Feb 23 </B>should be 
greyed out (disabled). If not, click it. If you are going to generate a 
prediction for a date outside this range, you will need to click other buttons so that the entire date range for the prediction is covered.
<li>In box <B>6, Set the file to save the occultation elements from the search</B>, 
<br>* the check box to <strong>Automatically save the search results</strong> 
should be left unchecked.<br>* leave the filename as generated. <li>In box <B>7 Do the search</B>, set the <B>Increase miss distance </B>to zero. 
<br>* Note at the bottom-left of this box the source of asteroid elements being 
used, and their date;<br>* At the bottom-right of this box, ensure the check box
<strong>Clear the previous results from Memory</strong><b>&nbsp; is checked.<br>
* </b>click <b>Search</b>.
<br><li>You will now see events listed as the search progresses. Progress can be monitored by the progress bar; the 
name of the asteroid currently being considered is listed at the top of the display box.
	<li>When the search is completed, you will be taken to the form <strong>List &amp; 
Display</strong>, where the events are listed in chronological order.
</ul>
<h2>Step 3 - List &amp; Display predictions</h2>
<ul type=1>
	<li>The number of events listed is shown at the top left of the form, under 
	the button List Events. In the test run conducted for this topic, 535 events 
	were found (but this may change as a result of different orbital elements 
	being used).<li>Generally, you will not be trying to observe events when the 
	solar elongation is small. In the orange filter box, check <strong>Solar 
	elongation &gt;</strong>, and set a value of <strong>30</strong>. 
	Click <strong>List Events</strong>, and note how the number of events is 
	reduced to 426.<li>Events with a small magnitude drop can be hard to detect. 
	In the orange box, check the <strong>Magnitude drop &gt;</strong>, and set the 
	value to <strong>0.2</strong>. Click <strong>List Events</strong>, and 
	notice how the number of events is reduced to 337.<li>Click the menu item <strong>Sort events... by star magnitude.</strong> The list will now be sorted with the brightest stars at 
the top of the list. Using <strong>Sort events</strong>, sort the list by date.<li>
	Now let us identify events that might be observable in either North America 
	or Europe. In the purple filter box check the <strong>Path crosses </strong>
	check box. Then enter the following longitude/latitude values :&nbsp; (-100, 
	50), (30, 50), (-100, 30), (30, 50). (You can pre-define regions using
	<strong>File... Edit list of regions</strong>, and select predefined regions 
	using <strong>File...&nbsp; select region...</strong>) This will select all events where the 
	occultation path crosses some part of the quadrilateral set by those 
	coordinates. Click <strong>List events</strong>. 33 events are listed.<li>Click the menu 
	item <strong>Sort events... by star magnitude.</strong> The first entry is 
	an occultation by 25 Phocaea on 2018 Jan 23. Place the cursor on the line, and click to select it. This will bring up a map showing the occultation path, with details given in the header area.
<li>On the map, place the cursor somewhere on the path on one side of the Earth 
globe and double-click. Note how the coordinates of that location appear at the 
top of the form, just above the plot. Do the same on the other side of the Earth 
globe, and note how the Earth appears to rotate a small amount. This rotation 
represents the orientation of the Earth at the selected location at the time of 
the occultation at that location.
<li>Click the button at top left with '4' </B>on it. Note how the map is drawn at a larger scale. Try the other numbered buttons to see the effect.
<li>Click the button '16'. Select the menu item <strong>Options... Export 
buttons - enabled</strong>, At the top right of the form there will be two 
drop-down boxes for Sites and Names. Select the <B>USA Short.site </B>from the left drop-down box. You may notice some small circles drawn on the map. On the right-hand drop-down box, select 
<strong>all</strong>. </B>The names of towns will appear on the map. [To control how sites are drawn,
<a href="#14/Help/html/Site editor.htm">edit the Site file</a>.] <br><li>Anywhere on the map, right-click, and select <B>View in GoogleEarth</B>. The centre line of the occultation path is green; the path limits are blue, and the 1-sigma variation of the path limits are shown in red.
<Ii> While in GoogleEarth, under the View menu item, click <B>Switch to Google sky</B>. Now place the cursor back on the Occult map of the occultation path, right-click, and select <B>View star in GoogleSky</B> 
	a second time. GoogleSky will now zoom in on the star. [Close GoogleEarth/Sky]<br><li>On the Occult map, right-click, and select 
	<strong>Path coordinates</B></strong>. Note the effect of checking the <B>Include path where sun is up</B>. Close the <B>Path coordinates </B>box.

<br><li>On the Occult map, right-click, and select <B>Path distances for multiple locations</B>. In the drop-down box, select 
	<strong>North America.site</strong> file. In the menu item <B>Set distance limits</B>, select <B>Limit output to 1-sigma</B>. Note the listing of a number of cities, and their distance and direction from the occultation path. Change the site file to <B>World Main.site</B>, and note a different set of sites. Close the <B>Asteroid - Multi-location predictions
	</b>form. <li>On the Occult map, right-click, and select <B>Prepoint stars</B>. 
	The list of stars can be used to pre-point a telescope prior to the occultation so that the Earth's rotation will bring the occulted stars into the center of the field at the time of the occultation. 
	If you have downloaded the SAO catalogue from the Downloads form under 
	option #42, the SAO number will be given for all stars (if one exists). This 
	can assist setting GoTo type telescopes, which typically have the SAO star 
	number available as a star identifier. [Note - you can retrieve SAO numbers 
	using VizieR by checking the box at the top-right of the form - however this 
	is a very slow process.]<li>Increase the Lead-time in the box by an hour. Note how additional pre-point stars are now displayed. <li>Assume the occultation at 'your' location will be at 23h 3m 30s. Enter that time in the field above the list, and check the <B>Event Time </B>box. Note how the list changes to give the actual time the telescope needs to be pointing at the pre-point star.

<li>Adjust the fields for <B>Magnitude </B>and <B>separation</B>, and see how the list changes when you click <B>List stars</B>. Note that the value in the fields for Magnitude and Separation are retained between sessions.
<li>Close the <strong>Asteroid - Pre-point stars</strong> form. <li>On the Occult map, right-click, and select <B>Show large star chart. </B>Adjust the map settings at the top of the form to see how the map changes. <I>

<h1>To generate a 'personal' OccultWatcher feed.</h1>
</b>
<p>Individuals can generate their own 'personal' feed for OccultWatcher, 
allowing&nbsp; them to use the OccultWatcher functionality to manage events of 
interest to them. <span class="auto-style3"><strong>Importantly, if the user indicates in OccultWatcher they 
are planning on observing a 'personal' event, that event will become visible to other 
OccultWatcher users who have the Personal Predictions feed 
selected. </strong></span>That means that others may join you in observing 
events in your 'personal' events.</p>
<p>To create a personal OccultWatcher feed, simply click Save all listed events as a 'Personal' OW feed 
This saves the 
occultation elements of the events that are displayed in a file called <strong>OccelmntSubsetForOW.dat</strong>, in the Occult subdirectory <span class="auto-style2">\Generated Files\</span>. If you are running <span class="auto-style2">OccultWatcher </span>'OW' on your computer, simply 
copy this file to the OW subdirectory <strong>Personal</strong> (making no 
change to the file name), and the events 
will be included in <span class="auto-style2">OccultWatcher</span> (after 
OccultWatcher has done an feed update). This way, you can generate your own list of
