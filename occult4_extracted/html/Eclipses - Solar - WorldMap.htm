<H1>Solar Eclipses</H1>

The form for solar eclipse predictions has a list at the top of all possible eclipses that occur in a 10-year period. The 10-year period is set by changing the year to the left of the list (and pressing Enter). The available range of years is -13000 to +17000 - corresponding to the coverage of the  DE431 ephemeris. To display a prediction for an eclipse, simply select the eclipse in the 10-year list.

<p>When a solar eclipse is selected, a world map is generated, showing the region of visibility of the eclipse. The plot shows:<ul>
<li>Underneath the date line, the solar elongations of the palnets at the time of geocentric conjunction. If the separation is less than 1&#176 it is followed by a '&#8225'; if less than 18', by a '&#8224' if in solar occultation, or '&#167' if in solar transit (very rare).
<li>The path of central eclipse (if central eclipse occurs) - in purple.
<li>The limits of the Penumbral eclipse - in cyan
<li>The curves of maximum eclipse, and eclipse starting or ending, are shown in cyan. There are generally two such curves, corresponding to sunrise and sunset [although occasionally they are joined to form a 'figure 8' arrangement.] These are the looped curves at either end of the eclipse region. The loop to the right of the plot corresponds to the eclipse occurring at sunrise; to the left - at sunset. For both loops, the part on the right corresponds to the eclipse beginning; to the left - ending. The line through the middle of the loop is the line of maximum eclipse at sunrise or sunset.</ul>
<li>Underneath the plot is the version of Occult, the value of deltaT and its uncertainty (if greater than 1 second), and the ephemeris used.

<h2>Prediction Controls</h2>
<p>The various prediction options are available through the menu line, a right click menu (the left image below) or the 5 icons on the right of the form (the right below).

The file is saved in the <B>Predictions </B>subfolder, with a file name  of MoonLimb_yyyyMMMddLongxxxLatyyy.txt. The first two lines of the file give details of the date/time/location, and librations. Following are 360 lines for each degree in Axis angle, with each line having 100 values of the topocentric limb height at 0.01° in Axis angle and a height resolution of 0.01"
<TR><TD>Detailed map</TD><TD>This can be selected and drawn in three ways:<ul>
<li>Place the cursor on the map at a region of interest, and double-click - a detailed map centered on that location will be drawn;
<li>Place the cursor on the map at a region of interest, right-click, and select the Detailed map option from the menu. A detailed map centered on the cursor location will be drawn;
<li>Click the menu item Detailed predictions... Detailed map. A map will be drawn centered at a mid-longitude and 
mid-latitude of the eclipse region.

<h3>Eclipses where a planet is occulted by, or transitting, the sun</h3>
At the time of an eclipse it is possible for a major planet to be either occulted by the sun, or be quite close. Far more rarely, it is possible for Mercury or Venus to be transiting the sun during an eclipse (eg Venus on 15232 Apr 5). Eclipses where a major planet is closer than 1 deg to the sun can be identified using the menu item <B>Find close planetary conjunctions</B>. Details are provided<a href = "Eclipses%20-%20Solar%20-%20Planet%20conjunction.htm"> here</a>.
