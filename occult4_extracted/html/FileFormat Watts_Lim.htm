<P>The file WATTS.LIM is used to indicate whether the Watts Charts cover the point on the limb. The data in this file is provided in the P, D reference frame. P closely corresponds to Watts Angle. There are 361 entries, corresponding to 1-degree increments in the P co-ordinate. Each entry has two fields, which specify the limit of reliability of the Watts data in the D co-ordinate. Each entry is a two-byte signed integer; the first entry is the limit for +'ve D, the second is the limit in -'ve D - in units of 0.1 degree (ie divide the value by 10 to obtain the limit value of D in degrees).
