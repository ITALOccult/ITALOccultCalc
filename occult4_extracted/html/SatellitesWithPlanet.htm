<h2><br>Eclipses, occultations and transits - <I>with the Planet</I></h2>

<p>As moons orbit around a planet, they undergo eclipses, occultations and transits with the body of the planet. For Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, these events only occur when the equatorial plane of the planet is near to edge-on. This option is for computing these events.</p>
<p>The moons included in the predictions, and the frequency of events, are as follows:<ul>

<li><B>Jupiter. </B>Predictions are generated for Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Events involving Io, Europa and Ganymede occur continuously, whereas events involving Callisto do not occur for a period of around 3 years every 6 years.<br><br></li>

<li><B>Saturn. </B>Predictions are generated for satellites 3 to 6, and 8  (Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Iapetus). Events involving Mimas and Enceladus are not included as they are unlilley to be observable, and are large in number. Events occur for a period of about 4 years every 14 years. In the first half of the 21st century, events occur between Sep 2007 & Oct 2011,  Feb 2023 & Apr 2027, Nov 2036 & Aug 2041, and May 2052 to Mar 2057. 
<br>Events involving Iapetus occur about 12 months before the other satellites (and the time periods given above) because of the large inclination of the orbit. Because of the large inclination, additional events involving the transit of Iapetus, and of its shadow, on the rings of Saturn are included. The visibility of events against the rings on the 'far side' of Saturn involve two extra considerations that are unique to these events. They are whether, at an event time: the shadow of Iapetus on the rings is occulted by the disk of Saturn, and whether Iapetus is projected against the shadow of Saturn on the rings. These situations involve significant complexities in their determination, and are vary rare. They are not considered in the prediction; as a result it is possible for some Iapetus transit events to not be visible when they occur against the far side of the rings.<br><br></li>

<li><B>Uranus.  </B>Predictions are generated for the 5 main satellites (Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, and Miranda.) Events occur for a period of about 6 years every 42 years, with the latest series starting in 2004.<br><br></li>

<li><B>Neptune. </B>Predictions are generated for Triton. Events occur for a period of about 7 years every 82 years.  The next sequence starts in 2043.</li></ul></p>
<p>The source of the ephemerides used in the predictions is listed <A href="FileFormat%20SatellitesEphemerisSources.htm">here</a></p>

<p>The predictions give the mid-time of the events. However the events are not instantaneous. For Jupiter's satellites the duration is typically several minutes. For Iapetus, the duration can be around 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Predictions can be generated for any period of time. Importantly, the output can be limited to only those events that are visible from your location - that is, at the event time the planet's altitude > 0 deg, and Sun's altitude < -6 deg (<A href="EphemTwilight.htm">civil twilight</a>).</p>

<pPThe following is an example of an output, for satellites of Jupiter. (the format is the same for the other planets) The prediction is limited to those events which will be visible from Canberra (Australia)<br>

<p>The output is given in the form:<br><ul>
day, hour, minute, satellite no, event type, phase</ul>
with the following symbols being used:</p>

<p><pre>
<b><i><B>Satellite no</B>.</i>	1  2  3  4... 8</b>

<b><i>Event type</i>	Ec</b> [eclipse]
                  <b>Oc</b> [occultation]
                  <b>Tr</b> [transit]
                  <b>Sh</b> [shadow transit]

Phase	D  [disappear]
         R  [reappear]
         I   [ingress]
         E  [egress]
</pre></p>
<p>For example, an event listed as <br>
<b>    23  12 23.5  2.Ec.R</b><br>
means Satellite II reappears from eclipse at 12h 23.5m on the 23rd of the month.</p>

<p>Note that the day number is given only for the first event listed for that day.</p>
