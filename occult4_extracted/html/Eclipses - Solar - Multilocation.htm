<p>From this form you can generate local predictions for all site in a site file of your choice. Select the site file from the drop-down list at the top of the form.

<p>The predictions can be sorted by site name, Longitude or Latitude, under the menu item <B>Sort</B>.

<p>The multilocation list is intended for dissemination to observers prior to an event - such as via the internet. This can give rise to concerns (which can vary between legal jurisdictions as well as individuals) For this reason the output of the site coordinates can be either at a precision of 0.1 arc mins, or rounded to the nearest arcmins ending in 5. This is set with the <B>with Prediction... Limit site coordinate precision in output</B> menu item. The default setting is arcmins ending in 5 (to avoid accidental publication of accurate coordinates). <I>NOTE. The calculations are done on the basis of the actual site location, not the displayed rounded site location. </I>


<p>You can move to the forms for generating local predictions, the path coordinates, or the detailed map, using the menu item <B>Detailed predictions</B>.

<h3>Event details:</h3><ul>
<li>The site name and location;
<li>The UTC - for 1st and 4th contacts of partial eclipse, the time of maximum eclipse, and if the eclipse is central, the times of 2nd & 3rd contacts. Times are not given if the event does not occur, or the sun is not above the horizon. If the event occurs on the day preceding or following the date of the prediction, a '-' or '+' (respectively) occurs immediately after the predicted time.

<li>The position angle of contact - at start and end of partial eclipse, and start and end of annular or total eclipse;

<li>The altitude of the sun - at start and end of partial eclipse, and at maximum eclipse;
<li>If maximum eclipse is visible at the location, the magnitude at maximum eclipse;
<li>If central eclipse occurs at the location, the duration of the central eclipse. </ul>

[Note: The magnitude is computed as the fraction of the solar diameter that is obscured by the moon. During central eclipse, this value equals (diameter of moon / diameter of sun) - irrespective of location across the center path.]
