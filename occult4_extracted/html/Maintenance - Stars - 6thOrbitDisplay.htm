<H1>Visual binary stars - Display of Orbit and Measures</H1>

Where the WDS or 4th Interferometric catalogs indicate that an orbit is available, an image of that orbit together with the individual observations is available at the USNO web site. This option allows that image to be retrieved and displayed.

<p>Where there is more than one orbit associated with a system, all available orbits (as indicated in the 6th catalogue of Visual binary stars) are listed. The first orbit will be automatically displayed, Other orbits can be displayed by double-clicking on the orbit image identifier displayed at the top of the form. [The displayed image will identify the particular pairing.]
 
<h3>Interpreting the image</h3>
<I>The following explanatory text is adapted from the USNO web site:
</I><p>
In the orbit figures,<ul>
<li>green plus signs (<font color=green><B> + </B><font color=black>) indicate visual (micrometric) observations, 
<li>violet asterisks (<font color=purple><B><sub> * </sub></B><font color=black>) photographic measures, and 
<li>blue symbols (<font color=darkblue><B><sub> &#176 </sub> &#8226  &#9830 </B><font color=black>) various interferometric techniques (open circles, filled circles, and filled squares for eyepiece interferometry, speckle or other single-aperture techniques, and multi-aperture techniques, respectively).
</ul><p>Finally, <ul>
<li>a red "<font color=red><B> H </B><font color=black>" or "<font color=red><B> T </B><font color=black>" indicates a measure from Hipparcos or Tycho. 
<li>The dot-dash line indicates the line of nodes. 
<li>Scales are in arcseconds, and 
<li>the curved arrow at lower right indicates the direction of orbital motion.
