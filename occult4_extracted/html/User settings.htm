<P>A detailed Help description is not written yet. However an explanation is provided with every item. </P>
<p>A number of issues require comment.<ul type=1>
<li>The site name can be used as part of a file name. Accordingly, avoid using 
the characters indicated above the box.
<li>If there is a need to edit the URL addresses for the ftp downloads, that editing cannot be 
performed in the User Settings form. Rather a manual edit of the file:<br>
OccultUtilities.dll.config will be required.
<li>Optional catalogues - NOMAD. Occult can use the full NOMAD catalogue (98GB), or a special subset catalogue (5GB). To use these catalogues you need to specify the location of the directory, 'Nomad_Short' for the subset version, or 'Nomad1' for the full version. Also note that if you are using a USB drive, the drive allocation can depend on the USB port the drive is connected to. If this occurs, the program will be unable to find the Nomad catalogue if the drive allocation is different to that specified here.
