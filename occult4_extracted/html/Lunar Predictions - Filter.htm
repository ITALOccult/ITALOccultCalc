<p align=center><img src="LunarFilters.png">
<p>This form allows the user to have some control over the prediction content. It provides a set of options for excluding vertain outputs. All settings are retained between sessions. However the filters cannot be applied to predictions without first generating and displaying the predictions.
<p>The form is divided into two boxes - <B>Events to be excluded</B>, and <B>Messages to be excluded</B>.

<H3>Events to be excluded</h3>
You can limit 
<li>outputs to a certain hour range - which might be useful if you are only able to observe in a particular part of the night. Note that if you want to observe between (for example) 22hrs UT and 3 hrs UT, the Start time should be 22, and the end time 3 hrs
<li>exclude daytime events. The filter actually excludes events if the Sun's altitude is higher than -6 deg.- corresponding to civil twilight.
<li>exclude bright limb events.
<li>exclude events unless they are a double star, or a K2 star (that is, a star that is a target in the Kepler2 mission)
<li>exclude events where no light curve is available for the star.

<h3>Messages to be excluded</h3>
The full predictions include a range of messages providing extra information. In some circumstances the messages can clutter the prediction list. Some or all of the messages can be suppressed by checking the relevant boxes.
