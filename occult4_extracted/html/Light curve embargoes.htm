<H1>Light Curve Embargoes</H1>
<!-- Insert Header in above line -->
<P>This form enables the setting of embargoes for submitted light curves.</P>
<P>When an embargo is set, it is applied to pending submitted light curves. It 
does not apply to light curves that are already added to the main file.</P>
<P>When a file has been embargoed, the file will have an added extension of 
'.embargoed'.</P>
<P>To set an embargo, you:</P>
<ul>
	<li>click the header line in the list of <strong>Current embargoes</strong>. 
	This will clear the data entry fields, and set the default start and end 
	dates.</li>
	<li>specify the asteroid number</li>
	<li>set the year and month of the start of the embargo period. The default 
	displayed start is 6 months before 'now'.</li>
	<li>set the year and month of the end of the embargo period. The default 
	displayed end is 18 months after 'now'.</li>
	<li>specify the name of the person who has requested the embargo</li>
	<li>specify the contact details for that person</li>
	<li>click the button &quot;add as new Embargo</li>
</ul>
<P>&nbsp;The details of an embargo are displayed in the listing of <strong>
Current Embargoes.</strong></P>
<P>The details of an existing embargo can be edited by selecting it in the list 
of Current embargoes - which will display the details in the data entry fields. 
Change those fields as required. Then click <strong>Replace selected embargo</strong></P>
<P>An embargo can be deleted by selecting the embargo, and clicking <strong>
Delete selected embargo</strong></P>
<P>The current embargoes are saved whenever there is a change/addition/deletion 
of embargoes</P>
<P>The list <strong>Embargoed files</strong> is a list of all light curve files 
that are marked as embargoed on the basis of the displayed list of embargoes. 
This list is updated whenever there is any change in the embargoes.</P>
<P>When the main form menu option to display all submitted light curves is 
selected, all embargoed light curves will appear at the end.</P>
<P>An embargoed light curve can be edited at the same time as any other light 
curve.</P>
<P>A light curve marked as embargoed will not be added to the main file. It will 
remain in the <strong>LightCurveReports</strong> folder until the embargo 
expires.</P>
