<H1>Obtaining current reporting addresses</H1>
<p>Occult uses a list of reporting addresses that is maintaind on various servers around the world. This enables you to obtain 'current' email addresses without having to manually update addresses whenever one might change. You should update the addresses every few months or so. They are held in the file  Occult 4\Resource files\addresses.txt. 
<p>To update the address list:<ul>
<li>The form lists a number of sources (obtained from the addresses.txt file). The first in the list allows an HTTP or FTP address to be manually entered. [This should not normally be required]. The remaining items in the list identify sources for downloading the file of addresses. The corresponding address is displayed when a source is selected.
<li>Select a source, and click Download. If there is a problem retrieving the file, you will get an error message. Otherwise you will get a message advising that the file has been updated - and the list of sources will be updated.</ul>
<p>If you are unable to download the addresses from a selected site, try a different site. [This arrangement will allow you to obtain a current list of addresses even if a site becomes inactive.]
