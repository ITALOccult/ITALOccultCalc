The information provided is:
<li>Asteroid number and name
<li>the date of the event.<li><strong>SM</strong> - a flag 'y' to indicate the one or more shape models for that asteroid
has been fitted<li><strong>IR-dia</strong> - the diameter of the asteroid - obtained either from IR satellite 
measurements, or estimated from the asteroid's magnitude constant<li><strong>major</strong> axis of the fitted ellipse.<li>
<strong>minor</strong> axis of the fitted 
ellipse.
<li><strong>PA</strong> of major axis.<li><strong>%diff </strong>- The percent 
difference of the measured diameter compare to the IR-dia value.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<li><strong>Q</strong> - an indicator of the quality of the observation as a whole.&nbsp;<ul>
	<li>0 = 'No reliable position or size'
	<li>1= 'Astrometry only. No reliable size' Observation can be used to report astrometry, but nothing meaningful about the asteroid's size.
	<li>2 = 'Limits on size, but no shape'. Poor coverage around the profile, but a diameter is determinable (often with a fit to a shape model)
	<li>3 = 'Reliable size. Can fit to shape models'. Good coverage around much of the profile enabling a reliable determination of the asteroid's size - even without a shape model 
	<li>4 = 'Resolution better than shape models'. Profile of the asteroid well covered with highly consistent results
</ul>
<li><strong>crd</strong> - the number of chords used to derive the diameter<li>8 columns providing the volume equivalent diameter derived from a fit to a 
shape model. The number before the brackets is the diameter derived from the fit 
to the shape model. The elements within the brackets provide<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. the 
Model source. D = DAMIT, I = ISAM<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. the model number in 
that source; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. the quality of fit to the shape model. 
The qualities in <span class="auto-style6"><strong>Green</strong></span> are he ones to take note of. Those in
<span class="auto-style7">Blue</span> may appear in a line where some models 
have a Green element. These instances should not be used. The qualities in
<span class="auto-style8">Red</span> should not appear. 
<ul>
	<li><span class="auto-style8">0 = Not fitted. Too few chords to make a fit to the shape model.
	<li>1 = Bad occn data. The occultation observations are either inconsistent or unreliable, with no ready way of distinguishing between reliable and unreliable observations
	</span>
	<li class="auto-style7">2 = Model wrong. The shape model is clearly inconsistent with the observed chords
	<li class="auto-style7">3 = Minimum Dia. Usually associated with a single chord observation, with that chord being matched to the largest dimension of the shape model to give its minimum diameter<li>&nbsp;<span class="auto-style6"><strong>4 = Diameter but no fit. The chords do not sensibly match the shape model, yet it is possible to derive minimum and maximum possible diameters. [NOTE: flag 1 - Model wrong - should be used unless there is a degree of confidence that the derived diameters are 'in the right ball-park']
	</strong>
	<li><strong>5 = Poor fit. The shape model is generally consistent with the observed chords - but has some broad deviations
	</strong>
	<li><strong>6 = Good fit. The shape model has a high degree of correspondence with the observed chords.
	</strong></span>
	<li class="auto-style7">7 = Not constrained. The observations have been 
	compared to the shape model, but the distribution of the chords, or the 
	magnitude of the uncertainties, were such that no meaningful constraints 
	could be determined.
