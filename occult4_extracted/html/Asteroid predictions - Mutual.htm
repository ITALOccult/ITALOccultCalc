<H1>Mutual asteroid transits and occultations</H1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This form provides predictions of mutual asteroid events. That is, an 
occultation of one asteroid by another, or a transit of one asteroid in front of 
another.<p>
These events are very rare. On average, about 1 per year involving asteroids 
brighter than mag 16.<p>
Despite their rarity, it would seem that such events are observable. However 
before this functionality, predictions of such events have never been made by 
anyone.<p>
There are two aspects to generating predictions of mutual events. The first is 
to identify a close approach (appulse) of two asteroids, such that a mutual 
event might occur. The second is to analyse that appulse, and to generate a 
prediction of the occultation path should it cross the Earth.<p>
Occult does not undertake the process of identifying close appulses. That is 
beyond the scope of Occult. However lists of close appulses are generated by 
Brian Warner, and made available
<a href="https://minorplanet.info/php/asteroidappulses.php">https://minorplanet.info/</a> 
The lists are generated on an annual basis, at around October each year. The 
lists are limited to asteroids brighter than mag 16. 
<p>
The 
first year covered by the lists was 2020.<p>
Occult uses these lists to identify possible mutual event candidates, and then 
undertake a full prediction. The great majority of events analysed do not give 
rise to a mutual event.<p>
The factors affecting the occurrence of a mutual event are a little complex. One 
might think that the separation at appulse would be a good indication. However 
an appulse distance of just 1&quot; (2020 Oct 17) did not result in a mutual event, 
while a separation of 13&quot; (2022 July 22) did. A major factor is the 
distance between the asteroids as compared to the distance of the closer asteroid 
to the Earth.<p>
For each event that is found, two files are generated. They are held in the 
Occult subdirectory \<strong>Predictions\. </strong>One file is a <strong>.dat</strong> file that contains the 
path prediction in text. The other is a <strong>GoogleEarth .kmz file</strong>, to display the 
path. The file names commence with <strong>Mutual_</strong>, followed by the year, and then the 
component identifiers. For example:<p>
<strong>Mutual_2022_(23606)_1996_AS1_transits_(743)_Eugenisis.dat</strong></p>

<p>There are two types of mutual events. One is where the closer asteroid appears 
larger than the more distant asteroid. In this case the closer asteroid <strong>occults</strong> 
the more distant one. Conversely when the closer asteroid appears smaller than 
the more distant one, the closer asteroid <strong>transits</strong> the more distant one. 
Note that it is the <strong>apparent size </strong>that matters, <strong>not</strong> 
their <strong>actual size</strong>.</p>
<p>A mutual event involves two stages. 
At the beginning and end there is a partial phase, during which either the 
occulted, or the transiting, asteroid are crossing the limb of the other 
asteroid. During this phase there will be a decline/rise in the overall light. 
When the transiting asteroid is fully in front of, or the occulted asteroid is 
fully behind, the other asteroid, the light level is constant - being the 
magnitude of the asteroid that has the larger apparent diameter. In the 
predictions, the <strong>Total duration</strong> covers the time from the start 
of the initial decline in light, to the end of the end of the rise in light. The
<strong>Central duration</strong> refers to the period during which the light level is 
constant. </p>

<p>
The data given in the prediction is:</p>
<p>
Line 1. The date, asteroid identifiers (closer asteroid first) and type (either Transit or Occultation)</p>
<p>
Line 2.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The event type - transit or occultation</li>
	<li>The total magnitude of the two asteroids</li>
	<li>The magnitude drop during the event</li>
	<li>the Central duration of the event</li>
	<li>The Total duration of the event</li>
	<li>The widths of the Central path, and the Central + partial path, in km</li>
</ul>

<p>Line 4. The coordinates of the two asteroids (which are the same!), with the 
elongation from the Sun and moon, and illumination of the moon</p>
<p>Line 5. For the closer asteroid</p>
<ul>
	<li>Number and name</li>
	<li>Magnitude</li>
	<li>Diameter - both in km, and the apparent diameter in mas</li>
	<li>Distance from the Earth, in AU</li>
	<li>The uncertainty ellipse, as given in JPL-Horizons.</li>
	<li>The orbit identifier. The JPL-Horizons identifier of the orbit solution 
	number, and date of that solution</li>
</ul>
<p>Line 6. The same as for line 5, except it is for the more distance asteroid.</p>
<p>Line 7. The uncertainties in the prediction. Uncertainty in the event time, 
and the uncertainty in the path location - in the across-path direction. The 
distance is as projected onto the surface of the Earth</p>
<p>Thereafter there is a table of path coordinates. The table is very similar to 
the table of path coordinates for a usual asteroidal occultation. The table 
lists the coordinates of the central line, the UT time, Alt/Az&nbsp; of the two 
asteroid, the coordinates of the full occultation or transit path, and 
the coordinates of the outer limit of the 'partial' phase of the event. </p>

<h2>Generating the predictions</h2>

<p>
The form for generating the predictions looks like:</p>
<p>
<img src="AsteroidPredictions_Mutual.png"></p>
<p>
The process involves two steps:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Download an Appulse file</li>
	<li>Generate the events </li>
</ul>
<h3>Download the Appulse file</h3>
<p>The drop-box under <strong>Year</strong> lists all years from 2020 to the year after the present 
(that is, 'next year'.) The Next Year file will not be available until the 
latter part of the current year. To generate predictions for a year, select the 
relevant year, and download it. This will result in a file called <strong>
Appulses_yyyy.dat</strong> in the <strong>\Downloaded Files </strong>
subdirectory, with <strong>yyyy</strong> = the relevant year. This file contains 
all events listed in the monthly files downloaded from <strong>minorplanet.info</strong>.</p>
<p>When a file has been downloaded, it will be listed in the box headed <strong>
Available Years</strong>.</p>
<h3>Listing / Generating predictions</h3>
<p>The first step is to set the maximum separation at appulse, that will be used 
to eliminate appulses that cannot result in a mutual event. The default value is 
20&quot; is strongly recommended, although values from 40&quot; to 5&quot; are provided.</p>
<p>When a year is selected with a single click, the <strong>List of Possible 
Events</strong> will display all appulses in that year with an appulse 
separation less than the value displayed. If you have previously generated a 
prediction for an event, it will be marked with a&nbsp; &#10004; . Otherwise a dash 
indicates no more than that a prediction file does not exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When a year is double-clicked:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>List of possible events</strong> is populated with  
	events that meet the <strong>Separation filter</strong> limit (with a
	<strong><span class="auto-style1">-</span></strong> or &#10004; at the end of the line, 
	depending on whether a prediction has been previously generated)</li>
	<li>Work through that list to generate predictions. For each event there 
	will be either 4 or 6 downloads from <strong>JPL Horizons</strong>.</li>
	<li>The result for individual events is marked with an <strong>X</strong> if 
	there is no event, or a &#10004; if there is an observable event.</li>
	<li>Under the <strong>List of possible events </strong> box, there are two 
	lines giving the status of each event as they are worked through. The top 
	line is the event identification. The second line gives the minimum distance 
	of the path from the Earth's center (in Earth radii), the total path width 
	for that event (in km) and either '<strong>No event'</strong>, or '<strong>Event</strong>'</li>
</ul>
<p>When an event is found, its path will be briefly displayed. Also the path 
will be shown plotted in <strong>GoogleEarth</strong>. All events found in the 
list will be plotted together.</p>




<h3>Viewing predictions</h3>
<p>Any event in the&nbsp; in the <strong>List of possible events</strong> that 
is marked with a &#10004; can be viewed by simply clicking the relevant line.</p>
<p>Double-clicking on any line in the <strong>List of possible events</strong> 
will regenerate the prediction. The path coordinates remain displayed, and 
plotted on GoogleEarth.</p>
<p>The prediction files are held in the&nbsp; \<strong>Predictions</strong> subdirectory 
of <strong>Occult</strong>. The file name is formatted as</p>
<p><strong>Mutual_yyyymmdd_ ......</strong></p>
<p>where yyyy, mm, and dd is the date of the event. The file name also gives the 
asteroid identifications and event type - as in:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Mutual_20220722_(23606)1996AS1_transits_(743)Eugenisis.dat</p>
<p>Two files are generated for each event. The <strong>.dat </strong>file is a 
text file giving the event details and path coordinates. The <strong>.kmz</strong> 
file provides the event path in GoogleEarth.</p>
