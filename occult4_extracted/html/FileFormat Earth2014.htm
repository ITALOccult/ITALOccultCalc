<!-- Insert Header in above line -->
<P>This file contains the heights of the global topography at intervals if 1 
arc-min in each of longitude and latitude. The source of this file is&nbsp;
<a href="https://ddfe.curtin.edu.au/models/Earth2014/readme_earth2014.dat">here</a>. 
The the particular file used in Occult is the 'SUR' (Surface) file - which gives the 
elevation above MSL of the Earths surface - as in MSL over the oceans, and the 
icecap in polar regions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>The format of the file is stated as:</h3>


All gridded data (Table 2 and 3) with extension ".bin" is stored in "int16" and 
"ieee-be" format. Each grid file contains 10,800 x 21,600 = 233,280,000 records 
at 1 arc-min resolution, and is 455 MB in size. The elevation data is stored in 
cell-centred format (thus the poles, and integer meridians are excluded). 
The coordinates of the cell centres of the grid extends from 
 -90+1/120 deg to  +90-1/120 deg in latitude direction, and from
-180+1/120 deg to +180-1/120 deg in longitude direction.

Records proceed along parallels from West to East, then rows from South to
North. The first record is the South-West corner (-89.9917 deg latitude, 
-179.9917 deg longitude), and the last record is the North-East corner 
(89.9917 deg latitude, 179.9917 deg latitude).
