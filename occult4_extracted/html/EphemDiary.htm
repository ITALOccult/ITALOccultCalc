<p>Phenomena included in the Diary are:<ul>
<li>conjunctions of the moon and planets with each other, and with the stars Aldebaran, Pollux, Regulus, Spica, and Antares. Separation at conjunction must be less than 6 degrees. Lunar occultations are indicated if one occurs somewhere on the earth.
<li>perigee, apogee, and phases of the moon, and dates when moon has its greatest declination north or south
<li>eclipses (solar and lunar); transits of Mercury and Venus
<li>perihelion, aphelion, equinoxes, and solstices of the Earth.  [<I>Note - the precise time of perihelion/aphelion is relatively indeterminate, with the solar distance varying by only a few km over a period of 24hours. The date given in Occult may differ from other sources by up to a day, due to some simplifications incorporated in this part of the program.</I>] 
<li>opposition, solar conjunction, and stationary points of the planets
<li>closest distance to Mars
<li>greatest elongation of Mercury and Venus</ul<p>
