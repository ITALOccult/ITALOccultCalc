<!-- Insert Header in above line -->
<P>This form is intended to demonstrate shape model functionality, including a 
360° animation</P>

Controls on the form


</h2>
<h3>Select asteroid</h3>
<p>This table lists all asteroids which have one or more shape models on you 
computer. Click an asteroid to list all available shape models (under&nbsp; the 
table), with the first one being displayed</p>
<h3>Select Model</h3>
<p>This set of radio buttons lists all the available models for the selected 
asteroid - with the model identification next to it. Click a radio button, and 
that shape model is displayed.</p>
<h3>Form Opacity</h3>
<p>This slider&nbsp; control makes the form part-transparent - so that is can be 
overlaid a plot of an asteroid (in particular, an image generated outside of 
Occult).</p>
<h3>Date and time boxes</h3>
<p>These are used to set the date and time for the plot. By default, the date 
and time is displayed as the current date UT, with the time at 12 hrs UT.</p>
<h3>Display 1-degree animation</h3>
<p>When this is checked, then when <strong>Plot</strong> is clicked, the shape 
model rotates once about its axis.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The colour of the background (sky) can be selected here.</p>
<p><strong>Projection</strong></p>
<p>The default projection is against the sky plane. That is, how it looks to an 
observer on Earth. </p>
<p>The Earth Plane shows the features on the asteroid's face that faces the 
Earth, but the profile is of the shadow of the asteroid as projected onto the 
Earth's surface.</p>
<h3>Include axes of rotation</h3>
<p>Select whether the axes of rotation are plotted. Red is for the north pole</p>
<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>
<p>Draws the shape model. If -degree animation is selected, the model fully 
rotates about its axis .</p>
<h3>Displayed quantities</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Plot width in pixels. The default is 600. This can be changed between 
	300 and 600 using the check boxes at the bottom.</li>
	<li>Volume equivalent diameter - as a fraction of the plot width</li>
	<li>Surface-equivalent diameter - as a fraction of the plot width</li>
	<li>Quality - a measure of the reliability of the shape model solution. 
	Given for DAMIT models</li>
	<li>Version - the version of the shape model - given for ISAM</li>
	<li>Comment - any comments associated with the shape model</li>
	<li>Created - the date the model was first created. DAMIT only.&nbsp; Not 
	present for all models</li>
	<li>Modified - the date the model was improved. DAMIT only.&nbsp; Not 
	present for all models</li>
	<li>DAMIT V2 and V3. V2 is a superseded format. Always use V3.</li>
	<li>Update list of models. When new shape models arte downloaded, this 
	updates the list of models. Only needed if the form is not closed.</li>
	<li>Download all models - Downloads all DAMIT models</li>
