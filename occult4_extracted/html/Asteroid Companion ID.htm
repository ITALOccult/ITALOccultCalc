<H1>Identifying asteroid satellites</H1>
<P>When an occultation observation records events involving a satellite of the asteroid (including a component of almost similar size), the satellite must be identified in accordance with approved nomenclature. This is particularly important for when astrometry derived from the event is reported, as well as archiving the observations.<P>
The primary component of the asteroid is identified by its usual number. As a 
result, nothing is provided to 'alter' the identification of the primary 
component. However in systems where the two components are of a similar size, it 
will be important to correctly associate the observed chords to the primary and 
secondary components.<P>The secondary component is identified in one of two ways 
- depending upon the level of knowledge/acceptance of the satellite.<P>For 
satellites that are fully established, the nomenclature is the asteroid number 
in brackets, followed by a roman numeral identifying the satellite. For 
satellites that are poorly established, the nomenclature&nbsp; is of the form:<P class="auto-style1">
<strong>S/yyyy (aaa) n</strong><P>where yyyy is the year of discovery, aaa is 
the asteroid number, and n is the sequential number in the discoveries in that 
year relating to that asteroid.<P>&nbsp;By way of example, asteroid (45) Eugenia 
has two satellites - Petit-Prince, and S/2004 (45) 1.&nbsp; For archiving, and 
astrometry reporting, the three components are identified as:<ul>
	<li>45</li>
	<li>(45) I</li>
	<li>S/2004 (45) 1</li>
</ul>
<P>



Some asteroidal satellites have bee given proper names. For example, the two 
satellites of (216) Kleopatra&nbsp; are Alexhelios and Cleoselene. The numerical 
designations for named asteroids can be hard to track down, but a useful 
resource for this is
<a href="http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/astro/asteroidmoons.html">Johnston's 
Archive</a>. In this case, Alexhelios is (216) I, and Cleoselene is (216) II<P>



When editing observations involving a binary asteroid in the observations 
editor, a box will be provided to specify the identification of the companion. 
The identification entered in that box should be in the form of the 2nd or 3rd 
examples above.



<h2>



(90) Antiope<span class="auto-style2"> - a special case</span></h2>
<P>



This asteroid involves two components of almost identical size. To identify the 
components, plot the shape model in ISAM, with the axis of rotation displayed. 
The primary component is located 90° ahead of the marker indicating the 
direction of rotation, while the secondary component is located 90° behind.<P>
