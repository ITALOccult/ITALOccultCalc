<H1>Estimating Signal-to-Noise</H1>
The signal to noise ratio (S/N) provides an indication of the reliability of an observation. Also, as S/N goes below 1 the uncertainty associated of the measured time of an event increases.

<p>To estimate the S/N, you need two values - the Signal, and the Noise.

<li>The signal is the change in the light level as a result of the occultation. It is the difference between the mean signal before the occultation, and the mean signal after the occultation.

<li>The noise is the peak-to-peak variation in the signal. Frequently the peak-to-peak variation will be similar before and after the occultation. However where there is a difference, the larger variation is used.

<p>The following 4 examples illustrate the measurement of S/N. The red line indicates the noise values. The green line indicates the Signal value;

<p>The S/N in the four examples are:
<ul type =1><li>0.5
<li>1.0
<li>0.3
<li>1.0</ul>
Note that in example 4, the noise is taken as the large pre-occultation noise, not the smaller post-occultation noise.

<p>If the S/N is greater than about 1.5, the precise value of S/N is not critical. However if the S/N is less than 1, you should try to make an accurate estimate of the value to one decimal place.
