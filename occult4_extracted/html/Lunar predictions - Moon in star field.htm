<H1>Display of Moon in star field</H1>
<p>This option displays the apparent position of the moon against the background of the stars in the XZ80Q catalogue. 

<p>The form opens showing the current UT date and time, and the site location is that set in the User settings. Adjust these as required.

<p>For an animation, specify the duration to be covered by the animation (in minutes) and the step interval to be used in the animation (in secs)

<p>The plot can display 4 different fields of view - 0.7, 1, 2, and 4 degrees. Select the relevant field size. The larger the field size, the slower the animation.

<p>The animation can be saved as an animated GIF file. The animation parameters are set under <I>Animated-GIF.... Animated-GIF settings</I>, and the file created using <I>Animated-GIF... Create animated-GIF</I>. Guidance on the issues with creating an animated GIF file are given <A href="Animated%20GIFs.htm" >here</a>.
	


<p>The map drawn on screen has the following background colour coding:
	
<table columns=3 border=1>
<TR><TH NOWRAP>Colour</TH><TH>Meaning</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>Black</TD><TD>night-time</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Various shades of blue</TD><TD>twilight</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Light grey</TD><TD>sun above the horizon</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Brown</TD><TD>moon below the horizon</TD></TR>
</table>

<p>If an animation is running, it can be cancelled by clicking the Cancel menu item that appears during an animation.

<p>The time of the current display is indicated below the hr and min fields.

<p><B>Suggestion</B>: One of the things that can be illustrated in the animation is the changing direction of motion due to diurnal parallax. To see this effect, set a duration of 5000 minutes, and a plot interval of 300 seconds. During the animation watch the direction of movement of the stars. If there was no parallax, the directions would change in a continuous manner. However because of the effects of parallax, you will see the directions of motion changing in an oscillating manner.
