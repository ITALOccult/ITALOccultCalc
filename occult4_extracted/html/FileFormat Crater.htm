<B>CRATER.DAT </B> contains co-ordinates of craters, and their diameter in km. The file is used to plot craters on a simple map of the moon. The data is in the form:<ul>

aabbccNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN</ul>

where <ul>
<li>aa is the longitude (0.1 deg)</li>
<li>bb is the latitude (0.1 deg)</li>
<li>cc is the diameter (km)</li>
<li>NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN is the name of the crater.</li></ul>
all held as 2-byte signed integer.

<p><B>CRATER.BIN</B> is an expanded file that can be used for reductions of crater timings during lunar eclipses, as well as plotting craters on a simple map of the moon.  contains co-ordinates of craters, and their diameter in km. The file is used to plot The data is in the form:<ul>

aabbccNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNT</ul>

where <ul>
<li>aa is the longitude (0.1 deg)</li>
<li>bb is the latitude (0.1 deg)</li>
<li>cc is the diameter (0.1 km)</li>
<li>NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN is the name of the crater.
<li>T</li> is the type of feature. C = Crater, M = mountain, P = point</ul>
aa, bb, and cc are held as 2-byte signed integers. Divide by 10 to get the values in deg and km.

If Crater.bin is present, and the version of Occult uses Crater.bin, crater.bin will be used for plotting the map of the moon. Otherwsise Crater.dat will be used
