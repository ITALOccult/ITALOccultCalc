</ul>
<h2><br>2. Lunar predictions for an object</h2>
<p>There are times when you would like to know when the next occultation of a particular object will occur. Occult has functionality to make that easy.

<ul type=1>
<li>Select the Lunar predictions tab, then click <B>Predictions of single Objects</B>
<br><br><li>Set <B>Search From </B>to 2007; Set to 2008;
<br><br><li>In the box for star, from the drop-down box select <B>Regulus</B>. Click <B>Find Star</B>

<br><br><li>In the box at the bottom of the form, note the list of events. Select any one, right-click, and select <B>World Map</B>. See the occultation region.

<br><br><li>Place the cursor in the list of events. Right-click, and select <B>Plot ALL</B> listed events. View the world maps of all events.

<br><br><li>On the main form in the Planets group, select Jupiter. Set the Search to be from 2012 to 2012. Click <B>Find Planet</B>. Select the 2012 July 15 event. Right-click to view the <B>World map.</B>
<li>On the <B>TaskBar </B>find the <B>LunarOccultationPrediction </B>form, and open it. Note that the date is set to the relevant date. DO NOT 
ADJUST ANY OF THE DATE ITEMS ON THE FORM. All the details for the particular object are resident in memory ready for prediction using the functions on this form. For Planets, the data includes their main moons.
<li>Select the site file <B>WorldMain.site</B>, and <B>London </B>as the site. Click <B>Occultations</B>. Note the predictions for Jupiter, and its four moons - and the line indicating the durations for each event.
<li>Select any line, right-click, and select Compute Graze. Note how the graze prediction has two blocks. One for the object being fully obscured by the moon, the other for the moon just touching the object. 
Right-click on a line, and select Graze Map. Note how two lines are now drawn, corresponding to the two blocks

<br><br><li>Return to the form for predictions of single objects. Set the search period to 2006 to 2012. In the Asteroid box, select 1 Ceres. Click Find Asteroid. See the list of events in the box - which you can view using the tools previously described.

<br><br><li>Assume a magnitude 4 nova has just been discovered - and it is located at RA 7h 0m 0s, +24d 0' 0". Enter its coordinates, magnitude and a name, and click <B>Find Object</B>. See the list of dates for occultation. If you right-click an event and display a world map, the star's details will be in memory for local prediction. Go to the  <B>LunarOccultationPrediction </B>form, and generate a prediction. The visibility 
will be assessed on the basis of the specified magnitude, and the name of the object will appear in the star identifier field.
</ul>
<h2><br>3. Lunar predictions - Multiple objects for multiple sites</h2>
<p><B>Note </B>The functionality on this form is intended for regional coordinators. The functionality uses the Site files to control output.

<p>The following is a brief illustration of what this functionality provides.

<ul type=1>
<li>Select the <B>Lunar predictions </B>tab, then click <B>Predictions of Multiple Objects for multiple sites</B>
<br><br><li>In box <B>1 Select Sites</B>, select the <B>USA Short site </B>file.
<li>In the list of cities, check a nominal number of cities - Chicago, Washington, Boston and New York
<li>Set the <B>Star catalogue </B>to <B>XZ&lt;9</B>, and <B>Objects </B>to <B>Stars and Planets</B>.
<li>In box <B>5 Set date range </B>- set the date range to be from 2008 Jan 1 to 2008 Apr 1.

<h3>Ordinary Occultations</h3>
<li>Click <B>Compute Occultations</B>. Some progress bars will appear. When the program has finished, use Windows Explorer to look at the content of the directory <B>Occult 4/AutoGenerated Lunar</B>. You will find a directory for each of those site names. In each directory will be a text file and a zip version of the text file. The file name is the prediction period; the content is lunar occultation predictions for that site and period. [The zip and text file outputs can be controlled in box <B>4 Set output options</B>]

<h3>Grazing Occultations</h3>
<li>In box <B>3 Options for Grazes</B> check the boxes <B>Prediction text, Profile, Regional Map</B>. Set the <B>Plot size </B>to  medium. Set the <B>Observed data </B>to <B>P,D[+/-0.5], </B>and file format to PNG. Check the box to Hide Watts profile.
<li>Now click <B>Compute Grazes</B>.  Monitor the progress bars. When the program has finished, use Windows Explorer to look at the content of the directory <B>Occult 4/AutoGenerated Grazes</B>. You will find a directory for each of those site names - each of which is empty (they are used in the prediction process). The predictions will be found in the directory <B>'_Predictions'</B>. There are a series of Zip files with the file name being derived from the site name and prediction period.

<br><br><li>Open the zip file for <B>Washington. </B>
<li>Open the file <B>20080101 to 20080401 Graze Summary for Washington DC Summary.txt</B>, and note the basis of the prediction and the list of grazes.
<br><br><li>From the ZIP file, open the <B>Regional Grazes - USA Short.png </B>file, and the <B>Regional Grazes - USA Short.txt</B> files. The text file provides an index to the map. Note that the extent of the map is governed by the region covered by the site file, not just the selected sites.

<br><br><li>From the Zip file, open the <B>20080213 Graze of 470 Washington DC.txt</B>, and note the graze prediction. At the end of the graze prediction, note the '<B>Results of Observer scan'</B>, which includes Philadelphia (which was not a site selected for the prediction. The Observer scan considers ALL sites in the site file.

<br><br><li>From the Zip file, open the <B>20080213 Graze of 470 Washington DC.png</B>, and note the graze profile.
<h3><br>Fixed region grazes</h3>
<li>In the box for Fixed region grazes, set the year to 2008. The fixed regions are set in the User Settings, with 5 regions being predefined.
<li>Click Compute fixed region grazes. This option takes a while to run. Monitor the displayed date.
<li>When the program has finished, use Windows Explorer to look at the content of the directory <B>Occult 4/AutoGenerated Grazes/World</B>. 
<li>In the directory there are graphic files showing the occultation path of each occultation of a star brighter than mag 4.0, and any planet.
<li>Also in the directory is a graphic file for each region (1 to 5) showing all grazes in that region. The legend for the graphic is provided in an associated .txt file of the same name.
