<p>Occult relies heavily on data that is freely available. Items such as various star catalogues and the planetary ephemerides have been developed by government funded agancies or grants. Occultation and graze observations have been contributed mainly by the efforts of amateur astronomers (or as I prefer to call them, unpaid astronomers) from around the world. This contribution needs to be recognized and acknowledged.

<p>The philosophy behind my writing and maintaining Occult is to encourage useful observations of occultation phenomena, thereby increasing our knowledge of the world around us.  Accordingly: <ul type=1>

<p><li>Users of Occult are free to disseminate predictions or results generated by Occult in a non-commercial manner, provided it is in a context of encouraging (directly or indirectly) observations of occultation phenomena. All I ask is that wherever possible there is an acknowledgement that the data was generated by Occult.

<p><li>In circumstances where there is a desire to include Occult predictions or results in a commercial publication, you may do so provided (i) it is in a context of encouraging (directly or indirectly) observations of occultation phenomena, and (ii) it is a minor part of that publication (eg a one or two page column in a 50-page monthly magazine). The fact that the predictions or results were generated by Occult4 should be acknowledged.

<p><li>Where the success of a commercial publication is likely to be dependant upon the output from OCCULT, you do <B>not </B>have automatic permission to include Occult outputs in that publication. You will need to contact the author and seek written permission. 

<p><li>Where the output of Occult is displayed on GoogleEarth, GoogleSky or GoogleMaps, you will also need to comply with any copyright issues associated with those products.

<p><li>For the record, I reserve all rights to the <B>Source code and any decompilation thereof</B> - but with IOTA being able to continue to maintain/improve the program on the same basis as above, when I am no longer in a position to do so.
