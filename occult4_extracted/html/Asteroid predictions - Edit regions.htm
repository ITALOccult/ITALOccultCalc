<h1>Edit regions</h1>

<p>This form allows you to specify the coordinstaes of multiple regions to use 
in the filter for paths crossing regions.</p>
<img alt="Region editor" src="ListDisplay_EditRegions.png"><p>The left box contains a list of regions, alphabetically sorted by the names 
you allocate to each region. </p>
<p>In the main editing box at the top right, you specify the name of the region. 
You should try to make sure you give meaningful names to the region label. 
Following that you specify the latitude and longiitude of the four corners of 
the quadrilateral - in degrees. There is no requirement for the quadrilateral to 
be rectangular - it can be any 4-cornered quadrilateral, such as:</p>
<p><img alt="New Zealand" src="ListDisplay_EditRegions_NZ.png"></p>
<p>However you should not make the quadrilateral too large - especially in 
longitude - as this may adversely affect the reliability of the filter by reason 
of corners of the rectangle being below the horizon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To assist with correctly setting the corners of the quadrilateral, you can 
plot the selected region in GoogleEarth using the relevant button. To vary the 
region, change the coodinates and re-plot - until you are satisfied with the 
region. Then click <i>Add as New Region</i>. This will add the region to the 
displayed list of regions.</p>
<p>You can edit a region by selecting a region in the list (which will display 
the details for that region), making changes to the details (including to the 
region name) and then clicking <i>Replace selected region</i>. If you have 
renamed the region, it will appaer in the list in its new alphabetically sorted 
location</p>
<p>You can delete a region by selecting the region and clicking <i>Delete 
selected region</i>. You will be prompted to confirm before it is deleted.</p>
<h2>Saving the edited regions</h2>
<p>The editing done on the form needs to be saved. [The region data is held in a 
file <i>Occult 4\Resource Files\AsteroidRegions.txt</i>] Click <b>Save Regions</b> 
to save all the edits. You will be prompted to do the Save if you try to leave 
the form without having saved any edits to the regions.<br></p>
