	<p>The DAMIT system was upgraded at the end of October 2019 to V3, with the 
	V2 version of DAMIT ceasing at the end of March 2020. The changes 
	implemented in V3 necessitated a major change in the way Occult handles 
	DAMIT shape models. Specifically, rather than downloading images of the 
	shape model for a specified date + time, Occult now generates the image 
	locally. This results in a huge improvement in performance, as well as 
	independence from internet connectivity. Associated functionality is 
	described below.</p>

</ul><h2>3D Asteroid Catalogue</h2>
<ul><li><p>An additional source of shape models is the
	<a href="https://space.frieger.com/asteroids/">3D Asteroid Catalogue</a>. 
	Most of the shape models are in fact sourced from DAMIT. However it includes 
	a number of asteroids not included in DAMIT or ISAM. However this source has 
	not been used as it does not provide all the information needed to orient a 
	shape model for a specified date+time.</li>
</ul>
<h1>New Shape Model implementation</h1>
<p>The revision of the DAMIT website referred to above necessitated an overhaul 
of Occult to process the raw data that defines a shape model. That data is the 
orientation of the axis of rotation (&lambda;, &beta;), an epoch for the rotation, a series of 
vector coordinates that define the coordinates of the corners of triangles used 
to model the surface, and a series of numbers that links those vertices together 
to define faces. A typical model will have around 1000 vertices and 2000 
linkages. For some asteroids (particularly in the ISAM database) the number of 
vertices is of the order of 4000, with over 7500 linkages {and for the asteroid 
(25143) Itokawa there are 6146 vertices and 12288 linkages}. 
<p>The previous shape model implementation involved downloading images generated 
by the DAMIT and ISAM websites - with new downloads being required whenever a 
parameter was changed. This was slow, and heavily dependent upon Internet 
availability.<p>The new implementation involves downloading the model data. Once 
the data for a model has been downloaded, the model can be drawn for any 
date/time without internet access. Furthermore, as the image generation is done 
within Occult, a number of options are available that are not available from the 
image downloads.<h2>Downloading model data</h2>
<p>Two approaches for downloading the shape model data are provided on the
<strong>DAMIT and ISAM shape models </strong>form. 
<p>In the first approach, if the&nbsp; models for a selected asteroid are not 
present on the computer, Occult will download the relevant files. Of course, the 
download requires internet access. Once the files for that asteroid have been 
downloaded, shape models for that asteroid can be generated without internet 
access.<p>In the second approach, Occult downloads all the available shape 
models. Currently (Feb 2020) there are 4207 shape model files for DAMIT, and 
with a reasonable internet connection they are all downloaded in about 15 to 20 
minutes. There are 3122 shape model files for ISAM. However the ISAM server 
appears to be slow, and the download of all those files requires several hours.<p>
It should be noted that the great majority of asteroids with shape models have 
never been observed in Occultation. This leads to the following recommended 
approach:<ul>
	<li>for DAMIT shape models, download the entire dataset. This is done using 
	the menu option on the <strong>DAMIT and ISAM shape models </strong>form
	<strong>Shape Model Maintenance... DAMIT.... Download/update shape-model 
	files</strong></li>
	<li>for ISAM shape models - if you are an occasional user of shape models, 
	let Occult automatically download the required shape model files if they are 
	not present on the computer - eventually you will have all the files you 
	need in practice. If you are a regular user, set aside several hours for 
	Occult to download all available models using the menu option <strong>Shape 
	Model Maintenance... ISAM.... Download shape-model files.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Maintenance issues</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>DAMIT</strong> shape model data is subject to regular revision. 
This may include the addition of new models, the deletion of models no longer 
considered valid, and changes to the shape model data. For this reason users 
should periodically (eg every three months or so) run the menu option <strong>
Shape Model Maintenance... DAMIT.... Download/update shape-model files.</strong> This will automatically 
update the shape model data and files.<p>As at Feb 2020 the revision of <strong>
ISAM</strong> data is limited to updating the list of available <strong>ISAM</strong> 
shape models (using <strong>Shape Model Maintenance... ISAM.... update list of 
ISAM models</strong>), 
after which any new models can be downloaded using&nbsp; <strong>Shape Model 
Maintenance... ISAM.... Download shape-model files.</strong><h2>Files for shape 
models</h2>
<p>The files for individual shape models are held in the <strong>Occult</strong> 
subdirectory <strong>ShapeModels</strong>. <strong>DAMIT</strong> shape models 
are stored under their <strong>DAMIT</strong> model number (eg <em>1234.txt</em>). 
Note that the model number is not directly related to the asteroid number. ISAM 
shape models are stored using the asteroid number and the model number for that 
asteroid. The format used is <strong>Annnnn-m</strong>, where <strong>A</strong> is an alpha character that 
ensures the <strong>ISAM</strong> and <strong>DAMIT</strong> models are separated when the directory is viewed,
<strong>nnnnn</strong> is the asteroid number, and <strong>m</strong> is the model number for that asteroid.&nbsp; 
For example <em>A1219-4</em>. The total file size of all shape model files as at 
Feb 2020 is 320 MB.<p>Thee are two other files in that subdirectory that are 
critical to the shape model generation. These files contain information about 
the orientation of the shape model (including its rate of rotation) as well as 
associated comments and revision dates. These files are generated differently 
for DAMIT and ISAM:<p>For <strong>DAMIT</strong>, the data is obtained by 
downloading two files from the <strong>DAMIT</strong> site and linking/merging 
the data in those two files. This process necessarily creates a file that covers 
all models in the <strong>DAMIT</strong> database. This file can be updated 
using <strong>
Shape Model Maintenance... DAMIT.... Update list of available models</strong>. 
However this step is automatically done if you use&nbsp; <strong>
Shape Model Maintenance... DAMIT.... Download/update shape-model files</strong> 
to update the <strong>DAMIT</strong> models.<p>For <strong>ISAM</strong>, the 
required data is held in each individual shape model file. As a result, details 
for an asteroid are only present for shape models that have been downloaded 
<h2>Resulting improvements</h2>
<p>The following is a summary of the changes that have been enabled as a result 
of the local generation of the shape model images<ul>
	<li>Once model data has been downloaded, shape model generation is <em>very</em> 
	fast</li>
	<li>The shape model can be drawn 
in color or Black &amp; White. The color image is a bronze color (as shown 
	below).</li>
	<li>The axis of 
rotation can be drawn for both <strong>DAMIT</strong> and <strong>ISAM</strong> images - with the north pole being 
green and the south red. There is also a 'N' or 'S' drawn at the appropriate 
pole (if it is visible).</li>
	<li>The orientation of the model is defined by the 
ecliptic longitude &lambda; and latitude &beta; of its axis of rotation. These values can be 
varied between ±16° in steps of 4° - to ascertain whether a small change in the 
orientation of the axis would result in a better fit to observed occultation 
chords.</li>
	<li><strong>ISAM</strong> models that are duplicates of <strong>DAMIT</strong> models 
	are identified</li>
	<li>The need to provide for a different scale as between <strong>DAMIT</strong> 
	and <strong>ISAM</strong> images has gone</li>
	<li>The edges of the faces on the model can be highlighted. This is quite 
illuminating for many 'old' models which are not based on 'regular' triangles. 
The following shows an 'old' and 'new' type of shape model, with face edges 
highlighted. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="DAMIT%20faces.png"><p>&nbsp;<p>The following is an image of the form, together with a DAMIT model at small 
image scale. Note the absence of any slider to change the ISAM image scale 
relative to the DAMIT scale. The small font in the buttons for ISAM models #1 
and #3 signifies those models are duplicates of DAMIT models. <p><img src="DAMIT.png"><p>

<h2>Measuring asteroid diameters</h2>
Asteroid shape models can be combined with occultation results to derive the 
mean diameter of an asteroid. Guidance on what is involved is provided <a href="Asteroid_MeasureDiameter.htm">
here</a>
<br>
<H2>Binary asteroids</H2>
<p>As at 2020 there is only one binary asteroid with a shape model file - (90) 
Antiope. An algorithm has been implemented to provide for the components being colored 
differently. The colors are bronze for the primary component (that is, the first 
component in the file) and light green for the secondary. If plotted in grey-scale, 
the secondary is plotted darker.</p>
<p>The algorithm is based on an assumption of how shape models for binary 
asteroids may be constructed in the future, and may turn out to be wrong..</p>
<h2>Menu bar choices</h2>
<h3>with Model image</h3>
This menu item provides the following general items<ul>
<li><b>Draw mean Diameter on image</b> to selectively draw the mean 
diameter used in the displayed shape image. The setting is applied to all 
models, and is retained between sessions. Two 'mean diameters' are shown. One is the diameter of 
a sphere having the same Volume as the shape model, while the other is the 
diameter of a sphere having the same Surface Area as the shape model. The larger 
diameter is associated with the sphere having the same Surface Area. [Their 
calculation is based on the expressions of&nbsp; <strong>Dobrovolskis</strong> 
(1996) <em><strong>Icarus</strong></em> 124, 698-704 (1996), which are used in 
DAMIT]. A similar 
set of lines can be drawn on the plot of observations from the <strong>
Plot event observations</strong> form&nbsp; by setting the menu item <strong>
Plot options... Show MEAN DIAMETER indicator. </strong>Indeed, drawing 
the lines from the <strong>Plot event observations</strong> form will usually 
provide clearer lines.<li><strong>Plot model in Grey scale.</strong> This may be 
	important for publication purposes, where a B&amp;W image may be 
	desired/required. The setting is applied to all models, and is retained 
	between sessions.<li><strong>Plot on White background</strong>. Draws the 
	shape model on a white background. [Previously, <strong>DAMIT</strong> and
	<strong>ISAM</strong> downloaded models were always on a black background, 
	and the downloaded image needed manipulation to achieve a white background 
	when needed.] The setting is applied to all models, and is retained between 
	sessions.<li><strong>Show face edges on model.</strong> This is discussed 
	above. The setting is applied to all models, and is retained between 
	sessions.<li><b>Include rotational axis</b> to selectively include the axis 
	of rotation. The setting is applied to all models, and is retained between 
	sessions.<li><strong>Plot on Earth plane.</strong> The setting is applied to 
	all models, and is retained between sessions.. The default orientation of 
	the plot is the appearance of the asteroid in the sky as seen from the 
	Earth. However for prediction purposes it is more useful to plot the shape 
	as it would appear in projection on the Earth from an occulted star. To get 
	the best benefit of this you need to match the image scale to that of map of 
	the occultation prediction. The easiest way to do this is to plot the 
	predicted path in GoogleEarth, select a point near the center of the path 
	across the Earth, and adjust the scale of the GoogleEarth plot and the shape 
	model plot so that the length of he scale line on the shape model plot - as 
	projected on the GoogleEarth image - corresponds to the known diameter of 
	the asteroid. To do this correctly, make sure you choose a location near 
	where the path is closest to the center of the Earth, and measure the 
	distance along the path. Measuring across the path, or at your observing 
	location, may give erroneous results.<li><strong>Change polar axis orientation. 
	</strong>This 
	has a submenu that enable the ecliptic longitude Lambda, and ecliptic 
	latitude Beta, of the axis of rotation to be varied ion the range ±16°. 
	Changes are applied to all models displayed for the current asteroid. 
	However when a different asteroid is selected the values are reset to zero, 
	and are not retained 
	between sessions<li><strong>List Diameters from IR-satellites</strong>. Lists all available 
	diameters from the three IR satellites <strong>IRAS</strong>, <strong>AKARI</strong> 
	and <strong>Wise</strong>.<li><b>List model parameters &amp; light curve 
	dates</b> 
	This lists the following data for each shape models on your computer for&nbsp; 
	the currently selected asteroid:<ul>
<li>The identifier for the shape model
		<li>the ecliptic longitude &lambda; and latitude &beta; of the pole, and its period of 
		rotation<li>The zero date for the rotational ephemeris
<li>The ephemeris period of rotation - in hours
</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>If the Internet is available, a list of references to light curve measurements used to create the 
		selected shape 
model will be downloaded from DAMIT. This list is very useful as it indicates the length of time covered by 
the observations, and the date of the last observation. The longer the time 
period covered by the observations, the more accurate the rotational ephemeris. 
The longer the occultation observation is after the last observation, the 
greater the rotational uncertainty in the shape model.
	</ul>
	<li><strong>Display model fit to light curves (DAMIT)</strong>. This downloads a 
series of plots that show the fit of the light curve generated by the derived 
shape model to the source photometric observations. This can be useful in 
assessing whether the shape model is reliable.<li><b>Copy event JD, DAMIT epoch 
	and period</b> This copies the following data to the clipboard, for ease of 
	access:<ul>
		<li>Model Epoch = nnnnn <I>[... is the zero date for the light curve]</I>
		<li>Model Phase at Epoch = n.n° <em>[usually 0.0, but apparently not 
		always...]</em><li>Daily rotation rate = nnnn.nnnnnnn°/day<li>DAMIT Period (hrs) = n.nnnnn
		<I>[period of rotation]</I>
		<li>Best fit:   <I>[This is associated with fitting shape models to 
		occultation chords. The values correspond to the best fitted phase model]</I><ul>
			<li>Event JD = nnnnnn
			<li>Phase correction (revs) = n°<li>Rotation rate correction = n.nnnnnn°</ul>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Copy image</b>
	<li><b>Save image</b>
</ul>

<h3>with Phase models</h3>
This set of submenus provides 
options in relation to multiple images of a selected shape models, showing the 
shape model rotationally offset. This menu option is disabled whenever a 
different asteroid is selected - being enabled only when shape models for that 
asteroid have been downloaded. The options are:<ul>
<li><b>Download phase models at .... steps</b>. There are 5 options available. 
Each option downloads 10 shape models at equal intervals of time, the 5<sup>th</sup> 
model being for the specified date + time. The first option covers a full rotation 
of the asteroid in 10° steps. The other 4 options download the shape images at 
smaller intervals of time - allowing for a finer fit to occultation chords.
<li><b>Animate display of Phase models</b> Clicking this will result in a cyclic 
display of the phase models. The last phase model is displayed longer than the 
remainder. When an animation is started, a button 'Cancel animation' will appear 
- click this to stop the animation.
<li><b>Set animation interval</b> This displays a submenu to select the display 
interval for the animation. The currently selected display rate is indicated in 
the menu text (and is retained between sessions).
<li><b>Animated GIF - Setup</b> This opens the standard menu for setting two 
parameters for an animated GIF file - the display interval, and the number of 
cycles.
<li><b>Save Phase models as an animated GIF</b> This creates an animated GIF 
file of the shape model as displayed on the present form.
<li><b>Save Phase models as an animated GIF, against plot of occultations</b> 
This option is only enabled when the shape models are called from the Asteroidal 
Occultations observations editor. It creates an animated GIF file of the shape 
model as plotted on the plot of the occultation observations. It provides a 
simple way to demonstrate the fit of the shape model to the occultation 
observations.
<br><B>NOTE</B> animated GIF files cannot be created while the images are being 
displayed as an animation.</ul>
<h3>Keep form on top (or Return form to Normal)</h3>

<h3>Shape Model Maintenance</h3>
<p>This menu item is for maintaining up-to-date shape model data. There are two sub-items, for 
<span class="auto-style4">DAMIT</span> and <span class="auto-style4">ISAM</span></p>
<h4 class="auto-style4">DAMIT</h4>
<ul><li><strong>Update list of available models.</strong> This will access the 
	DAMIT website to retrieve data for all current shape models. This should be 
	implemented every month or so. For the occasional user, use it before 
	looking for whether a shape model is available.</li><br>
	<br><li><strong>Download/update shape-model files</strong>. This is for the 
	regular user of shape models. It will access the DAMIT website to establish 
	what shape models are available, and whether there are any shape models that 
	have been updated - and provide for downloading all the shape model files. 
	An initial download will take some time - there are over 4000 files (Jan 
	2020) occupying about 170MB. Subsequently the updating process is much 
	quicker.</li><br><br>
	<li><strong>Convert & add a single DAMIT model</strong>. This is used to create a shape model file using a standard file of shape model coordinates (typically 
	a file with an extension <strong>.tri)</strong> and a file of Spin 
	parameters. <strong><span class="auto-style3">The file of shape coordinates</span> </strong>will have the following format

The first line contains the number of vertices in the model, and the number of faces. 
	For a valid file, the number of faces is always 4 less than twice the number 
	of vertices. This line can also be empty. However a line before the first block of data must be present.
<br>* The first block are the coordinates of the vertices. The code requires each line in this block to be at least 40 characters long.
	If needed, pad out these lines.
<br>* The 2nd block gives the vertices for each face in the model. 
	These lines must be less than 40 characters long.<br>* For some source files, the characters v and f may be present to distinguish between vertices and faces. These will be ignored.<br>
	* The conversion process for this file is simple reformatting into a common format</li><br><p>* <span class="auto-style3"> <strong>The spin file may have multiple lines.</strong></span> The elements that must be present in this file, and in this order, are<ul>
<li>ecliptic longitude of the polar axis - degrees
<li>ecliptic latitude of the polar axis - degrees
<li>period of rotation - hrs</li>
<li>JD - the initial epoch for the rotation </li>
</ul>
<br>A typical Spin file may look like

In this example, the 4 elements required are the three fields of the first line, and the first field of the 2nd line.
<p>The conversion process for this file involves extracting certain data and adding it to the <strong>DamitModels.csv</strong> file</p>



	It doesn't matter how many lines are in the file, and it might even be just 
	one. The issue that matters is that the first 4 
	fields give the required data in the required order.<br><br>
	When the file has been converted, the Shape Model file is written to the 
	<strong>ShapeModels</strong> folder. The existing <strong>DamitModels.csv</strong> file, which contains the spin data for each model, 
	is renamed to include todays date plus a sequence number (like <strong>DamitModels 07-Feb-24_2.csv</strong>), with a new <strong>DamitModels.csv</strong> being written. 
	When several models are processed on the same day, the existing <strong>
	DamitModels.csv</strong> file is always renamed, but with a different 
	sequence number - so that you can always go back to an earlier version of 
	that file. When you are satisfied that the added models are working 
	properly, you can delete these renamed files.</ul>
	
	<h4 class="auto-style4">ISAM</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Create list of available ISAM shape models not in DAMIT.</strong>

	only needs to be done occasionally. <br> <br> </li>
	<li><strong>Download/Add ISAM shape model files</strong>. This accesses the
	<strong>ISAM</strong> website and downloads all shape models listed in <strong>
	Isam_AvailableAsteroids.csv</strong>&nbsp;The shape model files are written to the ShapeModels folder, and the spin parameters are written to <strong>Occult 4\ShapeModels\IsamModels.csv.</strong> </li><br>
	The distributed set of Shape Model files contains shape models for Ceres, Vesta, and Arakoth. These shape model files will be included.</ul>

<H2>Controls and Labels</h2>
The controls and labels on the form are as follows:<ul type = a>

automatically filled in. Underneath these boxes the corresponding JD value is 
given 
<li>An area to adjust the rotational period of the asteroid. The rate of 
rotation is adjusted using the up-down control - which adjusts the rate by

next to the boxes. Additionally, next to the date fields <B>δ Hrs </B>gives the 
effective change in hours at the specified date, while the box <B>Total at event </B>gives the

<li>The list box at the left lists the number of shape models available from 
DAMIT and ISAM for each of the listed asteroids. <br>The DAMIT model numbers are downloaded each time the form is loaded, so the list is 
always 'up-to-date'. The ISAM system does not have a convenient tool for 
obtaining a list of the number of models for each asteroid in ISAM. A tool for 
doing this is available in the Downloads form of Occult; it is intended for 
administrator use, as it takes many <I>many </I>minutes to retrieve the data 
required. Otherwise the list is updated by way of the normal Occult Updates 
process, involving a very quick download of the required file.
	<li>Two rows of buttons to display the downloaded model images. The top row is 
for DAMIT models; the bottom row is for ISAM models. The buttons are enabled 
only for models that have been downloaded. The button for the currently

model number, with the period of rotation In hours) being displayed underneath. Click the buttons to change the model being displayed. When the 
shape models have been called from the asteroid observations editor, changing

<h2>Notes on DAMIT &amp; ISAM models</h2>In the majority of cases, where ISAM models 
are available, they include the models available in DAMIT. However ISAM commonly 
includes additional models, and sometimes the best fit is obtained with one of 
those additional models. Accordingly it is important to check all available 
models against the observations. 

<p>Some issues with the list of DAMIT models are:<ul type = i>
<li>Up to 4 models might be available.<li>If an existing model is refined, the model will be updated under its DAMIT 
model number and the 'Version' (which is a date) will change. If the new model 
is very different from the old one (significantly different period and/or pole), 
which means that the old model was probably wrong, the old model will be erased 
and a new one will be created with a new model number. This way the existing 
model can be updated many times. [The case of replacing a wrong model with a 
better should not occur frequently.] Sometimes one of two models for an asteroid 
can disappear because it was rejected by new data (occultation or AO image, for 
example).</ul>

<h2>Interaction with the Asteroid Observations Editor</h2>
When the DAMIT/ISAM functionality is accessed from the observations editor, the 
program operates as follows: <ul type=a>
<li>Access the functionality from the Observations editor by selecting the menu 
item  <B>Light curve data &amp; Shapes...Display DAMIT &amp; ISAM shape models</B>. This 
will open the DAMIT and ISAM form. If no model is available in either DAMIT or 
ISAM for the particular asteroid, a message box will appear advising of this. 
Otherwise the DAMIT and ISAM form will have the date and time set to the average 
time of all the D and R events recorded in the editor for the displayed event, 
and then proceed to download all available models (assuming your computer is 
connected to the internet!)
<li>To have the model displayed on the plot of the observations, make sure the 
menu option <B>Plot Options... Add DAMIT &amp; ISAM shape images</B> is checked.
<li>You can control which model is displayed, and its size, from the Plot form 
by selecting the menu option <B>Plot options... <I>Show Shape model controls on 
plot.</i></b>

<li>The image on the plot of the observations is updated whenever<ul type =i>
<li>a different model is selected; and
<li>the scale of the image is changed.</ul>
This means that you can easily change the models to compare how they fit the 
observations, and you can easily change the model size to suit the plot size of 
the observations.
