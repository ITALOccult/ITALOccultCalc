<H1>Asteroid Observations - Solve double stars</H1>



<h2 class="auto-style2">Introduction - <em>essential</em> reading</h2>
<p>A double star detection will most commonly appear as steps in the drop and 
rise in the light curve. Occasionally it may appear as two separated drops in 
the light curve (with the drops being smaller than expected). In both cases, the 
observer has recorded two occultation chords - one for each component of the 
double star. The lengths of the two chords, combined with the asteroid's 
diameter, gives the separation of the two components in the across-path 
direction. The time displacement between the two chords gives the along-path 
separation of the two components. From these separations, the 
double star parameters of Separation and Position Angle can be determined.<p>However, a single 
observer observation does not provide enough information to derive a definitive 
solution. The reasons (assuming the chords are shorter than the asteroid's 
diameter) are:<ul>
	<li>For the main component, the chord can be fitted on either side of the 
	asteroid - giving 2 possible locations;</li>
	<li>For the 2nd component, its chord can similarly be fitted on either side 
	of the asteroid - giving 2 possible locations</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, there are 4 combinations of the locations of the two chords - 
giving <span class="auto-style1"><em>four solutions </em></span>for separation and PA.<p>The number of solutions is reduced 
if the location of one or both of the chords can be limited to a particular side 
of an asteroid. For example:<ul>
	<li>if there are multiple chords for one component, those chords can be 
	fitted to a specific side of the asteroid. If the other component 
	only has a single chord, there is an ambiguity in the side of the asteroid 
	that this chord passes - resulting in <span class="auto-style1"><em>two solutions</em></span>.</li>
	<li>if there are multiple chords for both components, both sets of those 
	chords can be fitted to a specific side of the asteroid. This removes all 
	ambiguity in the relative location of the chords, and leads to 
	<span class="auto-style1"><em>a single 
	solution</em></span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three other instances where the location of (typically, single) 
chords can be constrained to a specific location. They are:<ul>
	<li>the presence of a true 'Miss' observation of a particular component, which can 
	only be explained if the location of the positive chord for that component 
	was on the same side of the asteroid - and could not be on the other side. 
	[Note: for an 'undetected' observation to be treated as a Miss observation, there must be confidence that the 
	'undetected' 
	observation was of the correct target, and that there was adequate signal to 
	detect an occultation if one had occurred.]</li>
	<li>the length of the chord is about equal to, or greater than, the 
	asteroid's diameter - in which case it is taken that there is a single 
	location for that chord - which is aligned with the center of the asteroid.</li>
	<li>Two observers record an occultation - one records the primary star 
	(only), and the other records the companion star (only). If the separation 
	between the two observed chords is less than the diameter of the asteroid, 
	the locations of the chords against the asteroid are constrained so that the 
	asteroid was not located between the two chords - otherwise at least one of 
	the observers would have recorded events from both components. [An example 
	is <span class="auto-style10">2023 Jun 26, by (1330) Spiridonia</span>]. For 
	these events, the solution is best visualized by having the Plot option
	<span class="auto-style7"><strong>&nbsp;ALIGN primary and secondary star 
	events</strong></span>&nbsp; unchecked. [You may have to uncheck this option 
	several times during the analysis, as the program will frequently set this 
	option when solving a double star.] This is a plot of the event with that 
	setting unchecked. The plot shows the relative path locations; 2 is the 
	primary component, 1 is the secondary. As can be seen, the asteroid will not 
	fit between the two paths. As a result, the chords are limited to being on 
	opposite sides of the asteroid, giving a single solution.<br>
	<img Align=Middle Src="AsteroidObservations_Double1ofeach.png" width="300"><br></li>
</ul>
<p>Two further consideration are:<ul>
	<li>The closeness of the chords. When the 
separation between multiple chords is a small fraction of the asteroid's 
diameter, it is normally not possible to assert those cords definitely passed on a 
particular side of the asteroid. That is, despite there being multiple chords, 
there may still be ambiguity over which side of the asteroid those paths 
crossed.</li>
	<li>The uncertainty in the length of the chords. You must avoid focusing 
	entirely on the reported event time. Rather you must have regard to the 
	time uncertainties at the D and R points. Uncertainties that are a large fraction 
	of the asteroid's diameter generally prevent any conclusions about the side 
	of the asteroid. Also, when you have 1 chord with very small time uncertainties, 
	and another chord with very large uncertainties, the time uncertainties in that 
	chord may prevent it from resolving which side of the asteroid the first 
	chord passed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes an observer will record a step event on only one side of 
their light curve (that is, only on the D or only on the R. The usual explanation for this situation is that both 
components were occulted at the same time on the other side of the light curve - 
with the solution being computed on that basis. However if the magnitude 
difference is large, a small step visible at the bottom of a light curve may be 
invisible or obscured&nbsp; in the noise at the top of the light curve.<p class="auto-style7">
<span class="auto-style2"><strong>Important:</strong></span> <strong>the light 
curve from a single observer is incapable of determining which side of the 
asteroid the chords of either component of the double star passed. That 
determination can only be achieved when there are observations from multiple observers 
positioned across the occultation path. </strong>
<p><strong><em>Much of the functionality in the 
double star solution is associated with dealing with these three different 
solution types.</em></strong><h3 class="auto-style18">Occultation of only one 
component</h3>
<p>A further possibility is when the asteroid occults just one component of a 
double star. This is evidenced by the observed light curve drop being 
significantly less that the expected light drop. 
<p><span class="auto-style2"><strong>IMPORTANT.</strong></span> To justify the 
use of the <strong>One component only</strong> 
option, the change in the light curve from predicted must be significant. As a 
general rule, a difference that is greater than 20% of the full light level. 
This also means that this category will only apply when the magnitude drop is 
large; it is not easy to justify if the predicted magnitude drop is less than 
50%. An important reason behind this is that the observation does not provide a 
direct measurement of the other star, which means there is an inherent 
uncertainty in its brightness.<h3>Further reading</h3>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
<a id="Steps"><h2>Pre-analysis step. Associate the light curve falls and rises with the 
relevant component of the star.</h2>
<p>This step is critical. You cannot deduce the properties of the double star 
without first identifying those light curve drops and rises with one or other 
component of the star 

<p>If we identify the two components of a double as A for the brighter star, and 
B as the fainter star, the possible sequences of events are:<ul>
	<li>A-B-B-A, 
</li>
	<li>B-A-A-B, </li>
	<li>A-B-A-B, </li>
	<li>B-A-B-A, </li>
	<li>A-A&nbsp;&nbsp; B-B, </li>
	<li>B-B&nbsp;&nbsp; A-A</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional to these possibilities is the situation where where the D light 
curve has a step, and the R does not; or conversely the D not having a step but the 
R having a step. The explanation for this occurrence is that the 
occultations of the two components weresimultaneous at that time.<p>When you have 
multiple observers located across the path, <span class="auto-style2"><strong>do 
not assume that the sequence of events is the same for all observers</strong></span>. 
It is quite possible for one observer to have a sequence like A-B-B-A, and 
another observer have A-B-A-B. The reason is that the sequence depends upon the 
PA/separation of the components, the size/shape of the asteroid, and the 
location of the chords against the asteroid profile. The sequence <strong><em>
must</em></strong> be determined for each observer.<p>
When the brightness of both components is very similar, it may be difficult to 
match the steps to the A and B stars. To resolve this, one issue to consider is the duration 
between the first drop and the last rise. If&nbsp; the length of the 
corresponding chord is significantly longer than the expected diameter of the asteroid, you 
can assume the first drop and the last rise do 
not relate to the same star. If you can't make that assessment, the number of 
double star solutions is, in principle, doubled. This situation should be very rare, and Occult 
does not handle it. In this situation simply make an association based on your 
best guess (however unsatisfactory this might be) - and in any publication of 
the discovery, note this issue.<p>
Normally, you would take the brighter component as being the 'usual' star in the 
occultation, and the fainter component being the '2nd star'. However in the 
two-solution approach discussed below, there are situations where the fainter 
component is taken as the main star, and the brighter as the 2nd star.<p>&nbsp;<h2>
Special controls for the double star solution</h2>

<p>When an event involves a double star, an extra 'floating' panel appears that 
provides extra fields for the double star solution(s). That panel can be dragged 
around the plot form. That panel looks like:<p><br>

<img Src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20Doubles.png"width="300" Align=Middle> 

<p>This panel has 5 groups:<ul>
	<li>Set relative brightness</li>
	<li>Select solution type</li>
	<li>Set 
solution, and </li>
	<li>Solve solution. </li>
	<li>Publication details</li>
</ul>
<p>These groups take you through the process for deriving 
double star details from the occultation observation. Each group will be 
explained in order of use..<p>The controls specific to the double star 
solution are:<ul>
	<li>The group <span class="auto-style7"><strong>Double stars - show</strong></span>, 
	is enabled.&nbsp;
	<img Align=Middle Src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20DoublesComponents.png"width="250">&nbsp;
	This allows you to choose which set of chords of the event 
	are to be shown. The options are (i) the chords for both components, (ii) 
	only the chords for the main (primary) component, (iii) only the chords for 
	the 2nd star (companion) component. When either primary or secondary are 
	selected, the automatic solution capabilities are limited to those chords. 
	When 'both' is selected, the automatic solution considers all chords, and 
	can include the double star parameters of <strong>separation</strong> &amp;
	<strong>PA</strong> in that solution.</li>
	<li>Related to this setting is the <span class="auto-style10"><strong>Plot 
	options... Align primary and secondary star events</strong></span><strong>. 
	</strong>When this is 
	checked, there will be single ellipse displayed, and the chords for the two 
	components displaced in accordance with the current <strong>separation</strong> 
	and <strong>PA</strong> values. When this is not checked, the two chords of 
	an observer for the two components will overlie each other, and there will 
	be two ellipse drawn displaced in accordance with the current <strong>
	separation</strong> and <strong>PA</strong> values. This setting is retained 
	between sessions.</li>
	<li>On the <strong>Double Star panel,</strong> there are two check boxes 
	near the bottom to set whether the <strong>Separation</strong> and <strong>
	PA</strong> are to be included in an automatic solution. These check boxes 
	function the same as the check boxes for the usual parameters of the 
	location and axes of a fitted ellipse.<br>To perform an automatic solution 
	of all parameters, make sure these two boxes are checked, as well as the 
	boxes for the location and size of the fitted ellipse. Then use the 
	automatic solve button you would use for a normal event (ay the top of the 
	plot form)</li>
	<li>On the <strong>Double Star panel</strong> in the <strong>Solve solution 
	#n </strong>box, there is an additional automatic solve button. <img Align=Middle Src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20DoublesAutoSolve.png"width="30"> This button 
	is limited to solving the <strong>separation</strong> and <strong>PA</strong> 
	of the companion star. This means that after you have made a satisfactory 
	fit to the main star, you can automatically fit the companion star to that 
	same fit. For a one-solution event, you can then reliably move to a full 
	automatic solution using the automatic solve button at the top of the form, 
	with the relevant check boxes for the position and size of the fitted 
	ellipse being set as required. This gives you a final solution based on a 
	best fit to ALL the chords, not just one or other component chords.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of other controls on the <strong>Double Star solution</strong> 
form that will be detailed below.
<a id="Brightness">
<h2>Step 1. Set the relative brightness</h2>
<p>The relative brightness of the two components is needed for correctly reporting the astrometry. 
Why is this? Almost always, the double stars detected in an occultation are 
'discoveries' with separations that are two small to be resolved in the Gaia 
astrometry. That is, the Gaia position for these stars refers to the 
photo-center of the two stars, whereas the occultation analysis is centered on 
the position of just one of those components. So when we report the astrometry for the 
asteroid, we need to match the <strong>photocenter </strong> of the two stars we have 
detected with the Gaia catalog position. This is computed using the 
relative brightness of the two components.<p>The relative brightness also provides the magnitudes of 
the two components, which are required for publishing the double star discovery. 
This step of publishing will be discussed later. However publication is 
essential in order for the double star discovery to be incorporated the Washington Double Star catalog 
(WDS), and/or the 4th Interferometric Catalog. 
<p>The process of determining the relative brightness is quite straight-forward. 
The process does not rely upon or use any magnitude values generating 
by current light curve analysis software. Rather it is simply based on the 
relative light-level changes that occur for the two stars. The required light 
levels might be obtained fro a light curve measuring tool. But equally valid 
values can be obtained by displaying the light curve on the computer monitor, 
and holding an ordinary ruler against the monitor to measure the height of the 
light level changes.&nbsp;<p>The 
brightness ratio that is required is simply the ratio of the light curve drops at either the D or the 
R. Preferably you measure this at both the D and R, and then average the two 
values. In this process, there is no issue about whether or not the light curve 
drops to zero light level. It is simply the ratio's of the light curve drops.<h4>&nbsp;An 
example to illustrate the process:</h4>
<p class="auto-style8">Assume the 
following light curve levels: before the event&nbsp;1340; at the step on the D&nbsp; 870, 
at bottom of the D 600, at bottom of the R&nbsp; 580, step on rise of R 1100, 
full light at R 1390. Identifying the brighter component as A, and the fainter 
as B<ul class="auto-style9">
	<li>The light drops at D are 1340-870 = 470, and 870-600 = 270. Sequence 
	is A-B</li>
	<li>The light rises at R are 1100-580 = 520, and 1390-1100 = 280. 
	Sequence is A-B</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style8">So overall the sequence is A-B-A-B. The D and R for the bright star 
correspond to the first drop and the first rise.<p class="auto-style8">There are 
two fully equivalent ways you can 
enter these results into the first panel of the Double Star panel:<ul class="auto-style9">
	<li>Brightness 
ratio at D is 470/270 = 1.70. Brightness ratio at R is 520/280 = 1.90. The 
	average Average is 1.8. Enter 
this in the top box in the 2nd column. This will set corresponding values in the 
boxes in the first column, with the top box always being 100. The two boxes in 
the right column will display the magnitudes of the two components.</li>
	<li>Sum the height values for the A star, and for the B star.&nbsp; That is 
	470+520 = 990, and&nbsp; 270 + 280 = 550. Enter 990 into the top box in the 
	left column, and 550 into the bottom box in the left column. The top box in the center column will display the 
ratio (which will be 1.90). The two boxes in the right column will display the magnitudes of the two 
components. <span class="auto-style7"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>:
	<span class="auto-style7"><em>the value that is saved is the ratio (top box 
	in the middle column). The values you might have entered in the left column 
	are not saved. When the event is re-opened, the values in the left column 
	will have 100 in the top box, and the corresponding ratio value in the 
	bottom box.</em></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style8">If you only have values from one 
of the D or R, you use just those values in these steps.<p class="auto-style8">
Usually the 'A' star will be the brighter component, and the ratio will be 
greater than 1. However in the 2-solution situation, the A star might need to be 
the fainter component. In this situation, the ratio will be less than 1.<p class="auto-style8">
The form also requests an entry for the uncertainty in the ratio value. This 
flows through to an additional uncertainty in the reported astrometry.<p class="auto-style8">
The displayed magnitudes are derived using the ratio value, and the star 
magnitude as listed on the Observation Editor form in the star details.<p>&nbsp; 
<p>Normally the identification of the components of a double star has the 
fainter star as the 2nd star. However, for a single-chord detection of a double 
star has the length of one component aligning with the center of the asteroid,
<strong>Solution methodology- Scenario 2</strong> (see below) is enlivened - as 
there is only one location to place that chord - leading to two solutions rather 
than 4. This requires specifying the component responsible for that chord as the 
primary star, even if it is the fainter of the two components. When the primary 
star is fainter than the companion star, the Brightness ratio remains as 
Brightness drop of the main star / brightness drop of the 2nd star, which will 
be less than 1. This ensures the reported astrometric position is appropriately 
located between the locations of the two components.<h3>&nbsp;
</a>One component only events</h3>
<p>The light settings are set as described above, with the following settings:<ul>
	<li>Measure the light drop of the occulted star - and enter that for the 
	Main star</li>
	<li>Measure the light drop from the bottom of the light curve drop to the 
	expected drop level for the occultation. Enter that as the 2nd star<a id="SolutionType"></li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2. Select the 
solution type</h2>
<p>This selection is critical to deriving the double star solution(s). The 
critical underlying issue is: 
<p class="auto-style8"><span class="auto-style7"><em>for each component, do I 
know which side of the asteroid the corresponding chords passed</em></span>.<p>
To determine this:<ul>
	<li>In the <span class="auto-style7"><strong>Double stars - show</strong></span> 
	box, select <strong>Primary</strong>. This will display the chords for the 
	main star. Looking at those chords, and having regard to the uncertainties 
	at the D and R, can you be certain that those chords must have been located 
	on one particular side of the asteroid. If you are certain that this is the 
	case, you have established that there will be only one solution for the 
	location of that component relative to the asteroid. Otherwise there can be 
	two solutions.</li>
	<li>Repeat this, using <span class="auto-style7"><strong>Double stars - show</strong></span> 
	box, select Secondary. Ask the same question - are the chords limited to 
	being on one side only of the asteroid (one solution), or can they be on 
	either side (2 solutions).</li>
</ul>
<p>In making these assessments, it is important to remember the effect of Miss 
chords. The presence of a miss chord near a positive chord will likely limit the 
location of the chord to one side of the asteroid (&amp; hence just one solution) - 
on the basis that if the chord was on the other side, the Miss chord should have 
recorded a positive event. However to use the Miss event in this manner, you 
need to be confident that an event would be apparent in that light curve had an 
event occurred.(which is not always the case). </p>
<p>This assessment leads to the solution type to be followed for the event. The 
three options are:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>One solution.</strong> This applies where you can be certain 
	about which side of the asteroid each star passed. That is, you can 
	individually locate the chords of the main star, and separately the 
	companion star, against the asteroid. This situation leads to a single 
	solution with (usually) it being possible to do an automatic solution 
	involving both sets of chords, to set the best fit for all parameters.</li>
	<li><strong>Two solution</strong>. This applies when you can be certain 
	about which side of the asteroid one component passed, but not the other 
	component. This enables a unique location for the chords of one component, 
	and two locations (one on each side of the asteroid) for the other component 
	- leading to two solutions.<br>There are two important issues associated 
	with this situation.<ol class="auto-style11">
		<li>The astrometric solution needs to be based on the component where we 
		are certain about which side of the asteroid it passed. This will often 
		be the fainter of the components. In this situation, you need to go to 
		the main part of the observations editor, and change the observation 
		settings for each observer so that the '2nd star' box is clear for the 
		component where the location is certain, and 2nd star is set for the 
		component where the location is uncertain - irrespective of which is the 
		brighter component.&nbsp; And if the consequential '2nd star' is 
		brighter than the main star, the relative brightness ratio in step one 
		will consequentially be less than 1.</li>
		<li>If the chord(s) for the '2nd star' are similar to, or greater than, 
		the asteroid's expected diameter, that fact alone constrains that chord 
		to being aligned with the center of the asteroid. As a result, instead 
		of there being two solutions for the location of the 2nd star, there is 
		in effect only one solution. In this situation, use the <strong>One 
		solution</strong> option.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Four-solution.</strong> This applies when there is uncertainty 
	in the location of both components relative to the asteroid. Most commonly 
	this arises with events observed by a single observer. With both locations 
	being uncertain, there are 4 possible solutions.<br>There are two important 
	issues associated with this situation.<ol class="auto-style11">
		<li>The astrometric solution has to have regard to the uncertainty in 
		the location of both components. To this end, a separate setting <strong>
		<em>Set Offsets</em></strong> is required, as described below.</li>
		<li>If the chord(s) for one of the components is similar to, or greater 
		than, the asteroid's expected diameter, that fact alone constrains that 
		chord to being aligned with the center of the asteroid. As a result, 
		instead of there being two solutions for the location of the <strong>2nd 
		star</strong>, there is in effect only one solution. However there 
		remains two solutions for the other component. In this situation, use 
		the Two<strong> solution</strong> option, with the component with the 
		chord greater than the asteroid diameter being the main component, and 
		the other component being the <strong>2nd star</strong> component - irrespective of their 
		magnitudes.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Having decided the solution to be used, select that solution type. This will 
limit the options available in the <strong>Set Solution</strong> box to those 
which are relevant to the solution type. Also, when four-solution is selected, 
the Solve Solution box will include an extra group of elements that are specific 
to this solution type. </p>
<p>Note that unless the event is a '<strong>One component only</strong>' event, 
the <strong>One component only</strong> solution type is disabled</p>
<h3 class="auto-style7">One component only</h3>
<p>Where the occultation is of only one component of a double star (which is 
determined by the magnitude drop not being as deep as expected). This situation

<a id="Solve1">
<h2>Step 4. Determine the Separation and PA for the selected solution</h2>
<h3>Preliminary explanation</h3>
<p>Underlying the three solution types is the issue of relating the over-all 
position of the asteroid relative to the star. The issue is that usually our 
double star discoveries relate to stars which have not been resolved by Gaia - 
which means the Gaia position is of the photocenter of the two components, not 
just one component.</p>
<p>Where the chords of both components of the star relative to the asteroid are 
well defined, the&nbsp; position of the asteroid relative to the photocenter of 
the stars is a simple proportion based on the relative brightness of the stars</p>
<p>Where the chords&nbsp;of only one component of the star is well defined, the 
position of the asteroid relative to the photocenter is a proportioning between 
the position relative to the 'known' component, and the average of the two 
solutions determined by the fit of the other chords.</p>
<p>Where the positioning of the chords of both components are not well-defined, 
the astrometry is an average of all the solutions. This average is determined by 
first deriving the location of the average position for one component (which is 
achieved by a function referred to below as <strong>Component 1</strong>). The
<a id="Solve18">
position of the asteroid relative to the photocenter is a proportioning between 
this average position for the first component, and the average of the two 
positions of the other component relative to this average position for the first 
component.

<a id="Solve10">
Step 4a.</a>&nbsp; Solution methodology -&nbsp; one solution events</h2>
<ul type = a>
	<li>
	Using the <span class="auto-style7">Double stars - show group</span>, display just the primary events. Make sure the boxes for solving for PA and 
Separation at the bottom of the <span class="auto-style7">Double star solution
	</span>panel are not checked. Then use the usual automatic solve button at 
	the top of the Plot form to generate an asteroid ellipse that fits those 
	chords.
	<li>
<a id="Solve9">
	Using the <span class="auto-style7">Double stars - show group</span>, display
	</a>just the secondary events. This step is best done with the Menu item
	<a id="Steps0"><span class="auto-style10"><strong>Plot options... Align 
	primary and secondary star events</strong></span><strong> </strong>set to 
	True</a>. In the Solve solution group, set the check boxes for solving for the PA and separation. Now align the 
	the 2nd star events with the ellipse that was determined in step (a). Typically you 
	would start off manually setting a PA and separation to get the 2nd star 
	events in the approximate position. Then&nbsp; click the Automatic solve 
	button that is located in the Solve solution group. <img Align=Middle Src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20DoublesAutoSolve.png"width="30">&nbsp; 
	Multiple clicks will be required, and you can watch the 2nd star chords move 
	to match the ellipse that has been fitted to the main star chords. before doing an automatic fit. Typically you 
	will not get a perfect fit of the ellipse to the secondary events, because 
	they occurred at different points around the asteroid limb.<li>The next step is to display both ellipses, and both sets of events, to check 
that the allocation of events as between the primary and secondary is correct. 
	This is best done with the Menu item <a id="Steps1">
	<span class="auto-style10"><strong>Plot options... Align primary and 
	secondary star events</strong></span><strong> </strong>set to</a> False. 
	This will show two ellipses displaced by the set separation and PA, and you 
	will be able to identify where the limbs of those ellipses crosses the 
	chords of each observer. This can be particularly important in situations where 
	it would be expected that an observer would have seen events for both 
	components, but only one was reported - as you can associate that one event 
	with the correct ellipse/component. 
Also watch out for situations where the observer has reported what is in effect 
a mid-time for a combined primary &amp; secondary event; such observations need to 
be excluded from the solution (by zero-weighting them) - as they do not 
represent either the primary event or the secondary event (and therefore would 
distort the solution of either).
	<li>Once you are satisfied that the observations have been correctly attributed 
to the relevant components, you can proceed to the final solution. There are two 
approaches to the final solution:<ul type = i>
<li>It is usually appropriate to combine all the observations into a single 
least squares solution using the  <img Align=Middle Src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20DoublesNormalAutoSolve.png"width="30"> 
Automatic solve button. This has the advantage of combining the observations of 
both components to derive the shape and location of the asteroid. When doing 
this, select (as usual) as many of the 7 parameters (X &amp; Y of position, major &amp; 
minor axes, orientation of ellipse, PA and separation of the double star) that 
result in a convergent solution. <li>Occasionally the number of observations of 
		the 2nd star can be insufficient to allow a least-squares solution for 
		all 7 parameters to be solved. When this occurs, simply repeat step (b) 
		above to derive the separation and PA of the 2nd star.&nbsp; 
		<li>Note that if there 
is only one chord for the secondary star, you should be proceeding under the 
		2-solution approach.</ul>

Step 4c.</a>&nbsp; Solution methodology -&nbsp; four solution events</span></a></h2>
<p>This scenario most frequently arises when there is only one observed chord - 
with the observer recording stepped events. It also arises with two or more 
closely-spaced chords, or two or more chords with large uncertainties. It is more complicated than (1) and (2), in that the location of 
the center of the asteroid relative to the chords of each of the two components 
is not uniquely defined. As a result, the astrometric solution involves an 
average of the positioning of the chords for one component, AND an average of 
the positioning of the chords for the other component.
<a id="Solve19">
The <a id="Solve20">
position of the asteroid relative to the photocenter is derived as a 
proportioning between </a>t</a>he average positions of both components. The methodology is:</p>
<ul type = a>
	<li>Preliminary step. You will need to access the usual controls for fitting 
	a circle or ellipse to a chord. When the <strong>Set Chords</strong> button 
	is clicked, the double star solution form will be disabled, and you will not 
	be able to move it. So move it to a location where it does not cover the 
	usual controls you need to fit the chords.<li>If the <strong>Set Chords</strong> button is 
	flashing, you have not set the chords. In this situation you will not be 
	able to set the separation and position angle, or do any other solving, 
	until you have set the chords. If its not flashing, the chords have been 
	previously set; you can re-do those chords by clicking the <strong>Set 
	Chords </strong>button.<li>Click the <strong>Set chords </strong>button. This will bring up a form that looks like:<br>
	<br>
	<img Align=Middle Src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20DoublesOffsets.png" width="300"><br>When this form is displayed:<br><ul><li>the<strong> 
	Double Star solution</strong> panel is disabled; </li><br><li>the autosolve check boxes 
		at the bottom of that panel are cleared;</li><br><li>the <strong>Double star - show</strong> group 
	is disabled - but with it set to show the primary (main) star;</li> and<br><li>
		in the <strong>Find best fit</strong> group at the top right of the plot 
		for, the check boxes for <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong> and<strong> Circular</strong> 
		are checked, and the check box for <strong>Major Axis</strong> is cleared</li></ul><li>Usually there is no basis to treat the asteroid as 
	being anything other than circular, and leave the check box for <strong>
	Circular</strong> set. For the asteroid's diameter, you would normally you 
	would use the usual '<strong>Assumed diameter</strong> of the asteroid - and 
	have that check box set. <li>
	On the Plot form, use the usual processes to fit the observed chord 
	to the upper (northern) half of the asteroid. Then on the<strong> Set 
	double-star offsets</strong> form, click the button <strong>North chord</strong>.<li>
	Repeat step e, fitting the chord to the lower (southern) half of the 
	asteroid. Then on the<strong> Set double-star offsets</strong> form, click 
	the button <strong>South chord</strong>. 
	<li>Now click the <strong>Set the Offsets and Close </strong>button. This will<ul type = a>
		<li>combine the data from (e) and (f), and transfer the required values 
		to the<strong> Set double-star offsets</strong> form - where they are 
		displayed in two boxes at the bottom of the <strong>Solve Solution</strong> 
		group. The values in those boxes are color coded to match the color 
		coding in the <strong>Set Soln</strong> group.<li>clear the check boxes for 
		<strong>Center X</strong>, <strong>Center Y</strong> and <strong>Major Axis 
		(km).</strong> <span class="auto-style2"><em><strong>Do not check those

		group,&nbsp; with it set to show the 2nd star;</li><li>in the <strong>
		Solve Solution</strong> group, set the check boxes for <strong>Sepn
		</strong>and <strong>PA</strong>; and</ul>
	Clicking between the 4 possible solutions should result in the asteroid 
	circle moving, but always fitting the primary star chords.<li>Select the solution radio-button to be for
	<strong>Solution #1 </strong>Adjust the PA and Sep controls to fit that 
	chord(s) to the asteroid circle. <span class="auto-style2"><strong><em>DO NOT ADJUST THE POSITION OR SIZE OF THE 
	ASTEROID ITSELF</em></strong></span>!&nbsp; When you are near to a fit,&nbsp; 
	use the Automatic solve button that is located in the <strong>Solve solution</strong> 
	group <img Align=Middle Src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20DoublesAutoSolve.png"width="30">&nbsp; 
	to complete the fit. You have now made the first solution.<li>Select the solution radio-button to be for
	<strong>Solution #2</strong>. The asteroid circle should<strong> not</strong> 
	have moved in location. As in (h), adjust the PA and separation of the companion star
	<span class="auto-style7">so that the chord passes on the other side of the asteroid to the chord of 
	the first fit.</span> Once you have fitted 
	this chord, you have obtained the 2nd solution.<li>Select the solution radio-button to be for
	<strong>Solution #3</strong>. This will result in the location of the 
	asteroid circle moving to be consistent with the 'other' possible 
	location of the primary star chord. Again, and without adjusting the 
	positions and size of the asteroid itself , adjust the PA and Sep controls 
	to fit that chord(s) to the asteroid circle. Once you have fitted this 
	chord, you have obtained the 3rd solution.<li>Select the solution radio-button to be for
	<strong>Solution #4</strong>. Repeat step (j) in respect of this circle 
	location and&nbsp; chord. Once you have fitted this chord, you have obtained 
	the 4th solution.</ul>
<p>This completes the solution for four-solution events. You can display the 
chord locations for the four solutions by firstly setting the <strong>Double star - show</strong> 
group to display both components. Then simply click the relevant button in the
<strong>Set Soln </strong>group. Also, the Separation and PA for the solutions 
are displayed under each button.</p>
<a id="Solve1Only">
<h2 class="auto-style18">Step 4d.</a>&nbsp; Solution methodology -&nbsp; one component only</h2>

<p>In this scenario,
the separation an position angle are automatically set. The separation is set at 
67% of the asteroid's nominal radius (in mas), and the PA is set as a normal to 
the chords - within the range of 0 to 180 degrees. These settings cannot be 
changed.
</p>
<p>The separation setting is used to report a separation distance that is <em>
greater</em> than the specified value. The separation is set to less than the asteroid's radius, in consideration of 
the location of the chord relative to the center of the asteroid is not well 
defined, and the unseen companion could be on either side of the asteroid. 
Similarly, the PA is used to report an approximate PA of the companion (with a 
180 deg ambiguity). The PA is set to be normal to the chords; if the actual PA 
was in the direction of the chords, occultations of both components would be 
expected. While the value appears on the form as a precise value, the reported 
parameters for the star has thew PA rounded to the nearest 10 deg.</p>
<h2>Step 5&nbsp; Enter publication details</h2>
<p>This is for reference, and administrator use. It is important that double 
star discoveries are published, so that the double star gets entered into either 
the Washington Double Star catalog, or the 6th Interferometric catalog. To 
achieve this, the discovery MUST be published in a relevant journal, with USNO 
specifying the Journal of Double Star Observations (<a href="https://doublestarsjournal.org/index.php/jdso">JDSO</a>) 
is the most appropriate. Observations are submitted via
<a href="https://doublestarsjournal.org/index.php/jdso/about/submissions">JDSO 
submissions</a>. To do this, you must&nbsp;
<a href="https://doublestarsjournal.org/index.php/jdso/login">Log in</a>. If 
this is your first time, you will need to
<a href="https://doublestarsjournal.org/index.php/jdso/user/register">Register</a>.</p>
<p class="auto-style8">[<span class="auto-style10">Prior to 2025, the

<p>The details to be entered into the bottom of the form are (i) the date of 
submission to the JDSO - so that this fact is recorded to prevent double 
submissions; and (ii) when the publication occurs, to give a reference in the 
JDSO of where is is published. As shown on the form above, that reference is 
conveniently in the form of&nbsp; <span class="auto-style10">Volume, Issue, page</span>, 
such as<span class="auto-style18"> <strong>Vol 6, #1, pg 90</strong></span></p>
<p>The fields are set to Read Only, so that users can copy the data is required. 
To edit those field, the user must have Administrator Settings set, so that they 
can check the 'Edit' check box. The fields can be edited when they have a light 
green color. They are read Only when they have a light red color.</p>
<p>At this time, there is no automation of setting the data in these fields. The 
data has to be set manually by whoever is processing the double star submissions.</p>
<a id="Shapes">
<h2>Effect of Shape models</h2>
<p>The above processing solves the double star parameters - including 
uncertainty values - on the basis of a fit to an ellipse. However there are 
inherent limitations in the validity of the solution, given that asteroids are 
typically irregular objects that at best approximate an elliptic profile.</p>
<p>Where a shape model exists, a solution using a shape model can be derived for 
one-solution or two-solution events - but not three-solution events. The approach is to follow the relevant 
methodology. However instead of using the automatic fitting of the 
chord to the ellipse, the user needs to manually fit the chords to the shape 
model profile - and have some confidence that the diameter of the asteroid is 
determined by the fit of the chords to the shape model.</p>
<p>In many instances there will be more than one possible shape model. Occult 
does not have the capability to retain double star solutions for each shape 
model possibility. Where more than one shape model provides a reasonable fit to 
the observed chords, the user needs to undertake an investigation of past 
occultation results involving that asteroid - to determine which of the several 
shape models is in fact the 'correct' shape model. Having done that, the double 
star solution is derived using that shape model.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Saving/exporting/importing/deleting the double star solutions</h2>
<p>The double star solution is saved/retained in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you are working with an individual file for an event, by saving that 
	event after having made the solution(s)</li>
	<li>If you are working with the <strong>Historical Observations</strong> file, by updating

</ul>
<p class="auto-style9"><span class="auto-style17">The export function allows 
the double star solution to be maintained separate from any observations file.
