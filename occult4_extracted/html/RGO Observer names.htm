<h1>RGO Observer names</h1>
<p>The names of the observers for the RGO sites have been manually added from the lists provided in:
<li>RGO Bulletin No 183 (1943 - 1971)
<li>RGO Bulletin No 192 (1972 - 1980)

<p>The 1972-1980 data set provided specific correspondence between Station/Telescope identifier and the observer name. Accordingly these names were entered first. Names from the 1943-1971 data set were then added. Since these names were not specific to a particular telescope (<U>see below</U>), they are flagged with an asterisk (*) to indicate the inherent uncertainty in their allocation. However, from a comparison with the data added from the 1972-1980 data set it became apparent that the 1943-1971 data set listed plural names for a given station in telescope order. Further there were strong indications that they started at telescope '01' (or higher number when indicated), with a unitary increase in the telescope number. Thus the names were added wherever this structure appeared to apply, and consequently it is believed that most of the names with an asterisk are in fact correctly allocated to the station/telescope identifier. It is also likely that many station/telescope identifiers without a name should have the name for the preceding station/telescope identifier - although names have generally not been added on this basis. Finally, for a small number of sites the RGO data sets indicate that the observer's name was not known. These instances are marked with '?'.

<p>The following description of the observer names data is provided in RGO Bulletin 183:<ul>

<p>'… The list is arranged in order of station code number. The names of observers are repeated where they made observations from more than one station.

<p>'The telescope number has the following significance in this list. If it is blank, the observer timed the occultations using any of the telescopes listed under the station. If it is '&gt50', the observer timed the occultations using the telescopes numbered from 51 upwards listed under the station. Occasionally the range is further subdivided into '&gt25' and '&gt75'. Where there is more than one observer at the station this system of classification only permits one to deduce which group of telescopes in [Table 2] were used by a particular observer and hence which station/telescopes in [Table 1] contain his observations; it is not possible to deduce which particular observations were made by a particular observer. Of course, it is not necessary to know this when reducing the observations because each observation has a unique station/telescope position assigned to it and the value of the personal equation, where it is known, is given with each observation.

<p>'This seemingly awkward and ambiguous system of classification was forced upon us by the circumstance that at the time [the data] was being prepared the observer's names were not in computer readable form and therefore it was decided not to list the observers' individual code numbers with the observations as we thought they would not be required. However, during the period of the preparation of these tables, which were set aside for a few years because of more urgent work, the observers' names were key-punched and thus we were able to produce this listing. Nevertheless it was decided not to re-list the observations with the observer numbers included, because of the considerable amount of extra work that this would have entailed.'</ul>

<p>It would thus appear that the exact linking of observers to observation in the 1943-1971 period has been effectively lost.

<p>Finally, the earlier observations do not have any names in the RGO data. For the pre-1900 data the names are almost certainly available in the literature where the observations were originally reported (e.g.. Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society). However no attempt to retrieve that data has been made (or planned!).
