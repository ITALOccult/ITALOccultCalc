<!-- Insert Header in above line -->
<P></P>
<H2>Solar Eclipse predictions</H2>
<P>Generates predictions of Solar Eclipses. Predictions are grouped in a 10-year period that is specified by the user. Predictions include:<ul>
<li>World map, showing eclipse path</li>
<li>Calculation of path coordinates, and local circumstances</li>
<li>Detailed maps, with right-click functionality to generate local circumstances</li>
<li>Drawing the eclipse curves on Google Earth</li>
<li>Generating a list of local circumstances for multiple sites</li></ul>
Predictions are fully valid for historical epochs to at least 2000 BC.</p>
<h4>NOTE. The function for analysing Baily Bead timings includes an animation capability. This can be used to predict the occurrence and appearance of 
Baily's Beads for specified sites.</h4>

<H2>Lunar Eclipse predictions</h2>
<P>Generates predictions of Lunar Eclipses. Predictions are grouped in a 10-year period that is specified by the user. Predictions include:<ul>
<li>Contact times</li>
<li>Graphic showing the path of the moon through the umbra and penumbra</li>
<li>Graphic showing the hemisphere of the Earth where the moon is visible at each contact time.</li></ul>
Predictions are fully valid for historical epochs to at least 2000 BC.</p>

<H2>Transits of Mercury and Venus</h2>
<P>Generates predictions of transits. Predictions are grouped in a century period that is specified by the user. Predictions include:<ul>
<li>Geocentric contact times</li>
<li>Graphic showing the path of the planet against the solar disk</li>
<li>If the transit is 'grazing', the coordinates of the line separating full transit from partial transit, or partial transit from no transit. [Note - no more than one of these lines can exist at any one transit.]</li></ul>
Predictions are fully valid for historical epochs.</p>

<h2><br>Analysis of Baily's Beads</h2>
<p>The provides a tool for the identification and analysis of Baily's Beads observed during an eclipse. The basic features include:<ul>
<li>A single file for each observer, held in a subdirectory for that eclipse</li>
<li>Control over a range of plot parameters and ephemeris corrections</li>
<li>Ability to control which of the forms 'stay on top'</li>
<li>Control over the plotting of the graphic of the solar image, and the lunar limb</li>
<li>Ability to plot the results of grazing and ordinary occultations - to better define the lunar limb</li></ul>

<h3>Converting 'old' data files of Baily Bead observations</h3>
<P>The button <B>Convert old files </B>is used to convert the '.ini' files of observations maintained under winOccult 3.x to the format used in this version of Occult. Note that if a file has been converted, then amended - the conversion button will <B>not </B>overwrite the amended data with the old data.</p>
