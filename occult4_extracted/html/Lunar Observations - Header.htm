<H1>Header details</h1>
<P>On this form you specify the details that are provided in the Header section of the Occultation report.</P>

<p>The header details are usually common from one report to the next. Accordingly the form includes buttons to set the currently entered text in each line as a default value, or to insert the default value into the line. The current default values can be seen as a tooltip when you place the mouse over the buttons

<p>When a new report is created [File... New], the default values are automatically inserted.

<p>If you have previously submitted occultation reports, the easiest way to set the default text is to read a previous report into the editor. Then use the <B>Set as default </B>buttons to set the values as default values.

<p>The Place Name field is included with all observations when the observations are archived. The place name should refer to a geographic location close to where the observations were made. Among other purposes, it provides a means of confirming the correctness of the specified site coordinates. If you make observations from widely different locations, it is best if they are reported using different reports, so that the Place Name corresponds to the site location.

<p>The Email address is used to email reductions (and any queries) to the observer. It is not archived.

<p>The Representative field is also used only in the context of raising queries about the report. It is not Archived.

<p>The Message field is a free-text region where the person creating the report can include a message to the person who will be collecting and archiving the observations. This message is not archived. The message should be limited to matters that you think the person should be aware of when processing the report. In particular, if the report was a re-submission of observations, that fact should be set out here.

<p>The IOTA2009 report format does not include fields for a street address of the representative, or an identification of whom the report has been sent to.
