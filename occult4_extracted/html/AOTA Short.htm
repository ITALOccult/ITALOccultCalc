<H1>Short events - check</H1>
<p class="auto-style9"><strong><span class="auto-style10">This functionality is 
for assessing whether a light curve has a plausible occultation event lasting just 1 
or 2 frames. It may also assist with 3 frame events.</span></strong></p>
<!-- Insert Header in above line -->
<h2 class="auto-style1">Purpose</h2>
<P>This function is designed to check whether there are any very short duration 
events in the light curve, that might reasonably be caused by an occultation, 
but which cannot be definitely attributable to an occultation because the light 
curve is too short to exhibit the classical criterion of having a flat bottom. 
That is, events of 1 or 2 frame durations, and for 3-frame events where there is 
doubt the existence of a flat bottom.</P>
<P class="auto-style2">This check is <strong>not</strong> a determination of 
whether such an event is definitely an occultation. It is <strong>not</strong> 
equivalent to the 'Noise induced event' assessment of PyOTE. It is <strong>not</strong> 
a general test for whether an event (generally) might be caused by noise.<span class="auto-style3"> 
Rather it is simply a check of whether, in the absence of events spanning 
multiple exposures (where the flat bottom test can be applied), an excursion in 
a light curve can be reasonably attributed to an occultation event. </span></P>
<P class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"> 
The check indicates whether the excursion, is '<strong>probably</strong>' or '<strong>possibly</strong>' 
caused by an occultation. When the excursion falls below the <strong>'possibly'
</strong>level, that excursion is not distinguishable from noise (whether or not 
there was in fact an occultation)</span>.</P>
<P>Subject to any other issues with the observation that may be relevant:</P>
<ul>
	<li>a <strong>Probable</strong> event will be routinely treated as being an 
	occultation event (even though the fact of it being an occultation is not 
	100% certain).</li>
	<li>a <strong>Possible</strong> event will be routinely entered under the 
	new <span class="auto-style2">Quality of Fit</span> setting of
	<span class="auto-style2"><strong>Short duration event. No astrometry</strong></span>. 
	However Astrometry will not be routinely reported for such events.</li>
	<li>events that do not meet these two criteria 
	are indistinguishable from the noise, with the presence of an occultation 
	being indeterminate. <span class="auto-style6">Such events will be included in the data set of observations 
	as an occultation <strong>if (and only if), the 
	observer provides a written explanation of why they believe the light curve 
	indicates the presence of an event. This explanation will become part of 
	their observation, for future reference by those using the data.</strong></span> </li>
</ul>
<p>In all instances, the observer must provide a .csv file of the measurements 
to be used for assessment, and to create a light curve file to be archived at 
VizieR. <span class="auto-style7"><strong>Without a .csv file, such short events 
will not be included in the events data base.</strong></span></p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h2>Basis of the check</h2>
<P>The check is based on the following proposition:</P>
<P class="auto-style4"><span class="auto-style6">When the light curve is 
smoothed to remove long-term variations:</P>
<ol class="auto-style5">
	<li>&nbsp;A very short event can only be distinguished from the noise if its 
	excursion is significantly greater than all other excursions</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The light curves of all comparison stars can be assumed to not 
	involve any occultation events. Similarly they can be taken to have somewhat 
	similar noise characteristics to the light curve of the target stars. 
	Accordingly, when an excursion is found in the light curve of the 
	target star, there should be no similarly large excursions at any point in the 
	light curves of any of the comparison stars.</li>
	<li>The length of the light curve must be long enough to exhibit a full 
	range of noise variations.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Proposition 2 is very important, on the basis that if an excursion similar to that 
in the target star is found in a comparison star light curve, such an excursion 
is properly attributable to noise. That is, full confidence in the existence of a 
non-noise-related excursion in the target star light curve <em>requires</em> a 
comparison with the light curves of one or more comparison stars. However, noise 
characteristics/distribution of 
the comparison brightness is likely to be different from the target star if 
there is a large difference in their brightness, such that it may not 
provide a reliable comparison.</p>
<p>Proposition 3 is important for ensuring the noise characteristics of the 
light curve are well represented. For integrated light curves, the length is 
based on the number of points after the data has been binned to match the 
integration.</p>
<P>The results of the test include weighting based on the number of comparison 
stars used, and the length of the light curve.</P>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<P>For each light curve:</P>
<ul>
	<li>To reduce the effects of long-term noise variations, a running average 
	of the light curve is generated. 7 possible values for 
	the running value length are provided, with the default value being 25.
	<ul>
		<li>
		<P class="auto-style4">Large values of the running average reduce the 
		effect of long-term variations, with minimal effect on for mid-term and 
		short-term variations. Small values reduce the effect of both mid-term&nbsp; 
		&amp; long term variations. Use relatively short running averages only when the 
		signal has clear periodic short-term variations.</P>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The light level of the star is 
	then generated as a distance from that running average, for each point along 
	the light curve</li>
	<li>Compute the Mean, and Standard Deviation, of these distances.<ul>
		<li class="auto-style7"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>. The method uses the mathematics of a standard 
		deviation provide a convenient basis to <em>compare</em> the data - both 
		within a light curve, and between light curves. The numeric values derived using this approach 
		are not used (and should not be used) to assess a formal probability of the result. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Convert the distances to multiples of the standard deviation value. This 
	provides a modified distance from the running average 
	light curve that is based on the distribution of light curve values rather 
	than the distance value.</li>
	<li>Sort the modified distances by value, with the distance furthest below the 
	light curve having the largest value (distances above the light curve are 
	not used)</li>
	<li>Repeat for each comparison star. This provides data for each comparison 
	star that may be directly compared with the target star.</li>
	<li>Apply the Evaluation criteria - see below.</li>
</ul>
<p>To assist with the assessment of the results:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The distribution of the modified distances, for all 
	values greater than 2.0 is plotted for the target, and all comparison stars. 
	Similarity in appearance is an indication of reliability of the comparisons 
	stars for the evaluation. The values are binned in intervals of 0.1 units.</li>
	<li>The horizontal scale for all plots is set by the largest modified 
	distance from the 
	target and&nbsp; all comparison stars. </li>
	<li>The vertical scale is counts in each 
	bin, with values of 10 or greater being at the top of the plot.</li>
	<li>In each plot, the largest modified distance for that star is plotted in Red.</li>
	<li>For the target star, if the 2nd, or 2nd +3rd, modified distances are 
	consecutive with the largest modified distance, the modified distances for 
	the 2nd, or 2nd + 3rd, are plotted in Yellow </li>
	<li>Lists of the 20 largest modified distances, together with their frame number, 
	is provided. for the target and all comparison stars. This allows for the user to readily access the 
	numerical values of the modified distances 
	and make a manual interpretation. Each list is generated specifically for 
	that star, and generally has no correlation with any other list. The data in 
	each list can be copied by placing the cursor over the box, and right-click. </li>
	<li>The list for the target 
	star also shows the modified distances for each Comparison star at the same 
	frame. </li>
	<li>Above each plot there is a number giving the relative brightness of the 
	comparison stars relative to the Target star. Desirably, the comparison 
	stars should be of similar brightness to the target. Relative brightness 
	values greater than 5 times the brightness of the target,&nbsp; or less than 0.2 
	times the target, are indicated in dark red, with the list of distance values in pink. This 
	is to indicate that the values for this star may not be reliable.</li>
	<li>At the left of the panel is a box for the evaluation of the data. The 
	evaluation is whether an occultation event is either <strong>Probable</strong>, 
	or <strong>Possible</strong> - with an occultation event otherwise being 
	unlikely. The relevant frame # is given.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evaluation criteria</h2>

</table>&nbsp;<p>The practical effect of the last line of this table is to 
exclude any light curve having fewer than 50 data points from assessment. For a

<p>Finally, there is a further modification of the ratios based on whether the 
possible event extends for more than 1 frame. This modification only has regard to 
adjacent frames if their modified distance values is also greater than any other 
frame. <em>Where the modified distance values of the adjacent points are 
slightly less than that for a small number of other frames, the user may use 
their judgment as to whether the displayed ratio value should be adjusted

&nbsp;<h2>Assessment</h2>
<P>The assessment of whether an occultation event occurred is not a black and 
white test. It is possible (but not a routine occurrence) that there are 
additional characteristics or features of a particular light curve that might 
outweigh the following criteria, which will need to be considered in the context 
of that particular light curve. </P>
<P>The issues to consider are:</P>
<ol>
	<li>The primary indicator is whether the maximum value in the target box is 
	more than the scaled ratio value of the 2nd value. <br>The simple visual test for this 
	is: in the graph for the Target star, is there a large gap between the data 
	plotted in light blue, and the data point in Red - at the right side of the 
	plot.<br>For two (&amp; 3) frame events, the 
	height of an adjacent frame would be expected to be similar to that of the 
	primary frame. Such frames are plotted in yellow, to indicate they are 
	excluded from the test. That is, the 
	scaled ratio test is applied between the 1st and 3rd (or 4th) values.</li>
	<li>The light drop for the target star must be more than scaled ratio value 
	of 
	the largest value in all other light curve drops. When the largest light drop in 
	the target star has a similar (or greater) light drop in any of the 
	companion stars, you have a clear indication that the light drop in the 
	target star is noise, not an occultation.<br>The simple visual test for this 
	is: Is there a gap between the the red mark in the graph for the target 
	star, and the right-hand end of that graph. A gap means there is a greater light drop in one of the comparison stars.<br>
	However this interpretation may not be correct if the relevant companion star is much brighter or fainter than 
	the target star. That is, when the relevant list is pink. Greater regard 
	should be had to the other comparison stars.</li>
	<li>The distribution of the data displayed in the target and comparison 
	stars should be similar, as an indication that the noise signals are similar 
	in nature. A major difference indicates that conclusions relying on that 
	comparison star may be unreliable.</li>
	<li>If there are no comparison stars, any confidence that a single (or 
	short-term) event was not caused by noise is reduced compared to when the 
	noise of one or more comparison stars are available. Hence the large ratio value when there are no comparison stars. <br></li>
</ol>
<h2>Automatic interpretation</h2>
<P>The evaluation box gives the numeric value of the primary indicator. It is 
color coded as follows:</P>
<ul>
	<li>Values above the scaled<span class="auto-style8"><strong> Probable Occultation ratio:</strong></span> Green, with a tick. Such events can be considered for 
	reporting astrometry (subject to any other considerations that might arise 
	with the overall event processing)</li>
	<li>Values above the scaled<strong> </strong> <span class="auto-style2">
	<strong>Possible Occultation ratio</strong></span>: Blue, with a question mark. An event which 
	could plausibly have been caused by an occultation, but not sufficient 
	evidence to report astrometry. Such events can be included in the file of 
	observations, with the <span class="auto-style8"><strong>Quality of the Fit</strong></span> 
	code set to '<strong>Short duration event. No astrometry</strong>'.</li>
	<li>When the greatest value for the target star is less than the scaled 
	<span class="auto-style2"><strong>Possible Occultation ratio </strong>
	</span>of any star: Displayed in Orange, with
	<strong>??</strong>. This will typically indicate the event is noise. 
	However this may not be a reliable conclusion if the largest value is in a 
	pink box. The relationship to the largest value in other comparison stars 
	should be considered.</li>
	<li>Values less than the scaled <span class="auto-style2"><strong>Possible 
	Occultation ratio</strong></span>: Red, with a <strong>X</strong> . This indicates the 
	largest excursion is indistinguishable from the noise.<span class="auto-style10"> 
	<strong>Such an event will not be added to the file of observations unless the 
	observer provides the reason they believe there is an occultation event, 
	which will be included as part of their observation of the event. Such reasons should be less than 100 words, and 
	expressed in plain ASCII text with no paragraph breaks</strong>.</span></li>
	<li>When the two or three largest values for the target star are in adjacent frames, the numeric value is followed by <strong>&nbsp;*&nbsp; </strong>, 
	with that numeric value being the ratio of the 1st and 3rd (or 4th) values.</li>
</ul>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h2>Single chord events - coincidence with a prediction</h2>
<P>The predicted time of an event is, without doubt, relevant to assessing where 
in the recording one should start looking for an event. The length of the light 
curve to be considered is typically several ten's of seconds. For slow-moving 
asteroids, it may be minutes.</P>
<P>This is the <span class="auto-style6"><strong><em>ONLY</em></strong></span> 
purpose for using the predicted event time. The conclusion of whether a 
particular dip in a light curve is caused by an occultation must stand on its 
own. Coincidence, or near-coincidence, with the predicted time, is irrelevant 
and does not constitute a basis for asserting the observation was an 
occultation.</P>
<P class="auto-style4">There are those that want to use a Bayesan argument to 
give an event a higher probability if it occurs near the predicted time. That 
argument assumes a 'prior' (all Bayesian calculations depend on the 'priors' 
used) that is not flat - that is, we know the probability distribution of the 
event time. However <span class="auto-style6"><em><strong>we do not know that 
distribution</strong></em></span>. Bayesians reflect this lack of knowledge by 
using a flat prior (that is, the event has an equal probability of occurring at 
any time), and as a result the Bayesian calculation is unaffected by the 
observed event time. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h2>Multichord events - interpretation</h2>
<P>The concerns raised with Single chord events apply to multichord events.</P>
<P>The additional factor is coincidence with other observed chords. If the other 
chords are multi-frame observations, and you have a single frame observation, 
the possible interpretations are:</P>
<ol>
	<li>the single frame chord is close to the multiframe chords, such that from 
	those multiframe chords we know an occultation would have occurred. As a 
	result, the single frame result probably will add nothing to the multichord results. If 
	it is included in the solution, the effect might reduce the 
	accuracy/reliability of the overall result. In such cases, the event will be 
	included in the file, but excluded from analysis.</li>
	<li>the single frame chord is remote from the multiframe chords, such that 
	the possibility of there being an occultation is remote (at best). The 
	inference would be that the event that was considered to be a possible 
	occultation was a noise event. Such an event would be included as reported, 
	but excluded from any analysis.</li>
	<li>The single frame chord is arguably near where the limb of the asteroid 
	profile might pass, such that it could be considered a positive event that 
	assists in determining the size/shape/position of the asteroid. However such 
	a conclusion is dependent upon the level of certainty about whether the 
	recording was caused by an occultation, because the same consequences arise 
	when the chord is treated as a Miss chord. </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Light curve - depth of drop</h2>
<p>This tool does not include any consideration of whether the observed light 
drop is consistent with the predicted drop. For asteroids larger than 1 or 2 km, 
there should be consistency between the predicted and observed light drops. If 
the observed light drop is significantly less than predicted, it is unlikely to 
be caused by an occultation.</p>
<p>For small asteroids, the effects of Fresnel diffraction need to be 
considered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>

areas. Evaluation of 2.78 is well above the Probable value of &gt;2.08. Would

<p>Target has one red point well separated from the blue. The evaluation is 1.53, 
which is greater than the <strong>Possible</strong> limit but less than the
<strong>Probable</strong> limit - so the event is assessed as being a possible 
occultation event. However no comparison stars were measured; if 3 comparison 
stars had been measured and provided satisfactory results, the event would have 
been assessed as a <strong>probable</strong> occultation.</p>

<p>Two minute recording. The relevant frame is identified as #1104. Evaluation is 1.07, which is well below the <strong>
Possible</strong> limit of &gt;1.20. The Red point in the target plot is not well 
separated from the blue, so the largest light drop is indistinguishable from the 
noise - preventing any conclusion that an occultation occurred. The light curve 
for the companion has a similar distribution (graphs below) and similar 
non-separation of the red point from the remainder. </p>

<p>Target red point is nowhere near the right end of the graph. Comparison #2 graph has red point at right end. Its largest value is 5.5, at frame 1560 and adjacent, and 1520. The orange line in the light curve plot 
is the light curve of this comparison star, and shows these two noise drops. This indicates relative noise greater than anything in the target signal. 
<strong><em>However</em></strong> this comparison star is only 0.2 as bright as the target, so it has very poor reliability 
- and the list of modified distances is in Pink. In the Target plot there is no gap between the red marker and the blue, so the deepest drop is indistinguishable from all other noise. A 
short duration occultation event is not apparent in this light curve.

<p>A light curve with multiple deep drops. Red mark in target plot not at the end, plus not a large gap - so no short-duration event. However this light curve has a definite multiframe event at around 1215. It is not detected in this test because it has that width. Any events lasting 3 or more frames should be assessed on the basis of whether it has a flat bottom.

<h2>3-frame events - is the fact there are 3 consecutive points below the 
average light level sufficient to assert it was an occultation?</h2>
<p>Maybe, maybe not. The distinguishing feature of an occultation is a light 
curve with a flat bottom. Apart from the particularly wide event   in the middle 
of he plot, there are two other drops extending over 3 frames, each of which 
might be construed as an occultation if it was the only such light drop in the 
light curve. As a general proposition, such events should be considered under 
this test; however the presence of three points at a similar light level may 
justify not strictly applying the evaluation. However note how in this example 
the 'flattest three frame drop (leftmost) is, in the context of this light 
curve, definitely not an occultation event.</p>

<p>In this example there is a single 3-frame drop where two of the points could be 
described as intermediate light levels. For events like this, additional issue 
to consider are the predicted duration (3.0 secs) and the exposure duration (1.0 
secs) [ which could explain the intermediate points]; the possibility of Fresnel 
diffraction if the diameter is &lt; ~2km (14km) [which doesn't explain the 
intermediate points]. The Comparison#3 plot (purple) has several single-frame drops in 
its light curve, indicating that light drops that large are likely due to noise. 
The target star light curve does not exhibit a flat bottom, so it fails the 
flat-bottom test. This light curve is also quite short (99 frames) and therefore 
has a poor representation of overall noise. A somewhat longer light curve would provide greater confidence in the 
noise characteristics. </p>
