<H1>Demonstration of Lunar observations</H1>

<P>This demonstration will give you a basic overview of the functionality, using a grazing occultation held in the file of historical grazing occultations.

<h2>1. Retrieve observations of a graze</h2>
<ul type=1>
<li>From the <B>Lunar Observations </B>tab, click the <B>View/analyse historical grazes 1706 - now </B>button.
<li>In the fields at the top of the form set the year to 1975, and from the drop-down box select Spica. Click <B>List</B>.
<li>Place the cursor on any line of the event. <I>[<B>Note</B>: in this example, only one event is listed. Where more than one event is listed, you place the cursor on the line of the event of interest</I>.] Right-click, and select <B>Place event in Editor</B>. The Lunar 
occultation editor will now open, and contain the observations of this event.
</ul>

<h2>2. Overview of editor pages</h2>
<ul type=1>
<li>At the top of the form there are 4 radio buttons. <B>Check the Report </B>radio button. The complete ILOC report form is displayed.

<br><br><li>Click the <B>Header </B>radio button. This page is for editing the 5 lines that appear at the top of the report form. Buttons are 
provided at the right to save the current text on a line as a default value and to insert the default value into the line. [This enables you to retain your 'home' site details and add them into new reports.]

<br><br><li>Click the <B>Sites & Names </B>radio button. The left half of the form is for adding/editing site details. The right half of the form is for adding/editing the names of observers and recorders.
<li>In the panel for <B>Sites</B>, select a site in the middle of the list. Then try the following and note their effect<ul>
<li>In the coordinate section, there are radio buttons for the data format. Click each of the formats.
<li>Next to <B>Altitude </B>there are radio buttons to switch between metres and feet. Try changing the setting.
<li>Note the various drop-down boxes, which list all the options for completing the ILOC report.
<li>Note the edit buttons in the middle of the page. Click the <B>move site Up </B>button several times and note the movement of the site. Click the <B>Sort by Number </B>to return the site to its location. [Note use the <B>Move</B> buttons and the <B>Sort </B>buttons to 
order the sites; use the <B>Renumber </B>button to sequentially number the sites in 
their current order.
<li>Note the <B>Add as new site </B>button - to create a new site using the data shown in the edit fields, and the <B>Replace selected</B> button - which updates the currently selected site with the data shown in the edit fields..  
<li>Note the <B>Set selected as default</B>, and <B>Add default as new site</B>. These allow you to retain your home site as a default value, and insert it in a new report.</ul>

<li>Note the edit controls for the panel for <B>Names of Observers...</B>, which provide the same functionality as the edit controls for sites.

<br><br><li>In the menu, select <B>Sites... Display in GoogleEarth</B>. Note how the sites are plotted on GoogleEarth - and how this can easily identify data entry errors in site coordinates. <I>Comment. All sites were located on roads. In plotting the sites, it is assumed the coordinates are on the WGS84 system. The displacement evident in the plot is due to datum differences with old datums. These differences are not corrected in this plot - but are corrected in the reductions. </I>

<br><br><li>Click the <B>Events </B>radio button. This is the page for entering the observations.
Wherever possible the form provides the ILOC options by radio buttons or drop-down boxes.
<li>Select an event and note how the data is displayed. Click the <B>Identify star </B>button in the 
middle of the form to see how the form can identify the star. Note the sort options and how the events can be re-ordered. 
[And the renumber button to renumber the events sequentially]</ul>

<h2>3. Reduce and plot</h3>
<ul type=1>
<li>Click the <B>Reduce & Plot </B>button. A table showing the reduced observations is displayed. Note the options for sorting the listing that are provided on the menu bar.
<li>Select a particular event. Right click, and select <B>Display event against profile</B>. <Ii>This option is available for ALL events.</I><li>Place the cursor on a point on the lunar limb. Press the left mouse button, and move the cursor. Not how a line is drawn, Move the cursor so that the line is tangential to the lunar limb. The ToolTip box displays the slope of the lunar limb relative to the horizontal - which is needed for analysing double star observations.  Close the profile.
<li>Since this report is a grazing occultation, click the <B>Plot graze events against profile </B>button. See all event plotted against the lunar profile.
<li>Place the cursor over any data point and note the details of the observation appearing above the plot.
<li>The plot includes many of the options available in a lunar graze profile prediction for plotting past observations, and highlighting related observations. Try the various options under <B>Observed graze and occultation data</B>. Note how a plot in the [P,D] reference frame has very blurred mountains, whereas the plot in AA, L, B] is much closer to the particular graze results.
</ul>

<h2>4 Ordinary occultation results</h2>
<ul type=1>
<li>Close all the forms that have been opened so that you are back to the main form for Lunar Occultation Observations.
<li>Click the <B>View/Analyse historical observations 1623 - now</B>
<li>Select the radio buttion <B>Read a file
</B><li>In the drop-down box, select <B>RGO sites</B>.
<li>Highlight station <B>005 01</B> - observer <B>B Dawson</B>. At the top of the form, click the <B>Create report for 005 01 </B>button. Note how the observations are included in the editor. Do not close the report form while you perform the next ‘merge report’ steps.
<li>Return to the site list. Select the site 005 02 - which is by the same observer. At the top of the form, click the <B>Merge report for <B>005 02</B> </B>button. Repeat this Merge report step for site <B>010 02</B>.
<li>In the editor, check the <B>Sites and Names</B> radio button. Note how the three sites are listed.
Click <B>Reduce and Plot</B>, and view a reduction of all the observations. [This may take a little while...]

<br><br>
<li>Close the editor and reductions forms. On the form for selecting 
observations, check the <B>Search for star </B>radio button. 
<li>In the drop-down box, select the star Regulus. Click the Read button. The form now lists all reported ordinary occultations of Regulus. Select the menu item <B>with List...,  Reduce all and save</B>. At the bottom of the form you will see the results of the reduction of each event. When finished, view the file 
<B>Occult 4\Observations\Results\ZC1487 Residuals.txt</B>, which contains the occultation residuals for all occultations of this star. [The file name is based on the star number - in priority order ZC, SAO, and XZ].

<br><br>
<li>Return to the form for selecting observations, with the <B>Search for star </B>radio button checked. From the drop-down box, select Antares. Check the box <B>Double stars - highlight</B>. Then click <B>Read</B>. Note how certain lines are highlighted - they contain an indication the 
<span lang="en-us"></span>event involved a double star, or a possible double star.

<br><br>
<li>Return to the form for selecting observations, and check the <B>Search for name</B> radio button. In the <B>Observer's name contains </B>box specify <B><I>Smith</I></B>. In the <B>Site Name contains </B>box specify <B><I>Canada</I></B>.  Then click <B>Read</B>. This will list all observations where the observer's name includes the characters 'SMITH' and the site name includes the characters 'CANADA'. Note that the search is not case sensitive.
