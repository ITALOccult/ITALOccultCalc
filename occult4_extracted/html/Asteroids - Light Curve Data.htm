<H1>Asteroid Light curve data</H1>
<P>Light curve data is extracted from the Asteroid Light Curve Database. The entire database may be accessed through the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve link<A  href="http://www.minorplanet.info/lightcurvedatabase.html"  target=_blank> CALL </a>. However Occult accesses the data by maintaining a downloaded copy of one of the files in the database - <I>LC_Summary_Pub.txt</I>. Users should update this file from the Downloads page every few months...

<p>The informnation extracted from the Light curve database is:<ul>
<li>the albedo (for information only)
<li>the period of rotation; and
<li>the amplitude of the light curve.</ul>

The period of rotation is also converted into the angular rotation that will occur in a period of 10 minutes, as well as the time take for the asteroid to rotate 5 deg. If the observations extend over a period whereby the asteroid will have rotated more than 5 degrees, careful consideration about the effects of that rotation on the alignment of the observed chords will be required.

<p>The maximum amplitude of the light curve is also converted into an equivalent ratio of the major:minor axes. As a general proposition, an observed profile should not be significantly more elliptic.

<p>The minimum amplitude of variation is also given - for information only. It is not present for all entries. Most importantly it does not place any constraint on the expected ellipticity of any fit.

<h3>Codes</h3>
The following codes may appear at the start of the line giving the period of rotation:
