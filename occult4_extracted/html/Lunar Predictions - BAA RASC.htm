<H1>Generating predictions for the BAA and RASC handbooks</H1>
<P>Several publications provide basic lunar occultation predictions of bright stars, in a multi-column format. Occult can generate the data required to construct these predictions, as follows: <ul type = 1>
<li>Create a site file containing all required sites. In the site file it is appropriate to set the telescope aperture at 10cm.
<li>From the main Occult form, select Lunar Predictions, Predictions of multiple objects for multiple sites
<li>In box 1, select the relevant site file from the drop-down list at the top. Then check all sites that the predictions are to be generated for.
<li>In box 2, set the Star Catalogue to ZC
<li>In box 2, check Stars, and Planets. Do not check Asteroids
<li>In box 3 - no action required
<li>In box 4 - leave the 'Delete files after zipping' unchecked
<li>In box 5, set the date range for the predictions. Usually it will be a full year - in which case set the year in the first line, then click the 'year' button to set the remaining fields.
<li>Under the <B>Compute Occultations </B>button, check 'Use short output line'. [This setting is retained between sessions.]
<li>Under the <B>Compute Occultations </B>button, make a choice between two output formats. One gives Cusp Angle and % Illumination; the other gives Position Angle and Elongation.  [This setting is retained between sessions.]
<li>Under the <B>Compute Occultations </B>button, select the limiting magnitude for the predictions.
<li>Click  the <B>Compute Occultations </B>button.</ul>

The predictions will now be generated and save to file. The files are located in the directory Occult 4\AutoGenerated Lunar\, in a directory that has the same name as the site, and with a file name that corresponds to the date range of the prediction.

The predicted data is as follows, giving Elongation and Position Angle

<h3>Created a multicolumn list</h3>
The final step is to merge the predictions into a multicolumn list. Up to three sites can be merged into a single prediction. list. To do this:<ul type = 1>
<li>Under the <B>Compute Occultations </B>button, click the <B>Merge [BAA & RASC] </B>button
<li>Select the prediction file to appear in the first column using the <B>Read a file </B>button. The file dialogue box will open in the AutoGenerated Lunar directory. The predictions will be found in subdirectories having the site name, with files names having the date range. If you inadvertently select the zip file of the predictions, you will get an error message.
<li>Repeat for the second site. Repeat for the third site (if required).
<li>Click <B>Merge & Save</B> to merge the observations into a single list, and save it to a location of your choice</ul>

<b>Note</b>
<li>Note that the date is set by the event in the first column. It is possible for the events in the later columns to occur on either the preceding or following day. As a result the list needs to be checked for any events occurring near the 23hr/0hr UT boundary - as there may be a need to change 0hrs to 24hrs to match the displayed day (if the 0 is in the 2nd or 3rd site column), or change 0hrs to 24 hrs and change the date to the previous day (if the 0 is in the first column). 
<li>To create a tab-separated list, open the file in Excel - using fixed column widths. Then save the file as a tab-seperated text file.
