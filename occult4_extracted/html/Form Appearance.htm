<H1>Appearance of Occult - and Font size</H1>
<P>From time-to-time people report that the appearance of the forms in Occult is incorrect, with the text not being properly contained in the controls or adjacent areas.

<p>The underlying problem is the need to have informative text on the various forms in Occult. Occult is a complex program, and there is a need to provide as much guiding information on the forms as possible, to facilitate the use of the program. This leads to a need to keep the font small so that text fits within the controls.
<p>However the font size is set on the basis that the program is being run in the default environment. There are two common user settings which 'upsets' this arrangement.<ul type=i>
<li>The user uses has changed Windows to use 'Large Fonts'; or
<li>The user has changed the Windows settings in order to make the computer run faster. In particular, under Control Panel, System,  Advanced System Settings, Performance... the user has selected a custom setting that does <I>not </I>'Use visual styles on windows and buttons'. </ul>
If these changes are made, the forms in Occult will generally not display properly. Unfortunately, the effort required to change Occult to display everything correctly when the font size is increased  is huge, with serious re-design work required for many forms. This would include using tabbed control pages to handle all the required controls on some forms - which will make those forms much harder to use. This is not going to happen any time soon...
<p>However many people will want to use large fonts in their normal PC use. Consequently there is a need to have some easy way for people to set their computer to use their preferred font generally, and the standard font when using Occult. A simple solution is that of Aart Olsen, who advises:<ul>
My solution was to create another user, named of course "Dave", in Windows, for whom the screen resolution (Control Panel > Display) is set to default instead of the larger setting I like. Normally I leave Dave running all the time -- I figure it's good exercise for him -- and just switch to that account whenever I want to do something in Occult.
