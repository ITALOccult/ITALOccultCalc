<P>Searches for asteroid and planet occultations can be conducted against a file 
containing a single star position. This form allows editing of that file.

<p>The data elements are self explanatory on the form.&nbsp; The form now 
provides fields for the epoch of the star position, and its radial velocity - so 
that the effects of foreshortening can be properly calculated.<p>&nbsp;<p>The file is 
saved in .csv format in the directory Resource Files., with the file name
<strong>UserStar_MinorPlanetSearch.csv</strong><p>

<p><B>Note</B>. A particular use of this file is for generating update predictions using improved orbital elements of an asteroid. In that environment, the user would typically create a user file specific for the prediction, and use Occult functionality to run the prediction via external calls.
