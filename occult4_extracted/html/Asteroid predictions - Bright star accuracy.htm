<H1>Astrometric accuracy for bright stars</H1>
<h3>The following is an edited version of email comments provided by Jean Lecacheux (Paris Observatory).</h3>

<p><B>Background</B>. <br>The following comments were provided in the context of a prediction of an occultation of the bright star delta Oph  by (472) Roma on 2010 July 8. The catalogue positions for delta Oph in the Hipparcos2 and the FK6 catalogues are significantly different, and the underlying question is whether the cause may be associated with the presence of an unknown companion star.

<p><I><B>Question</B><br>Or, is it likely that the primary star (target star for this  occultation) has a close much dimmer companion?</I>

<p><B><I>Answer</I></B>
<br>Sure it is! delta Oph indeed might have some close invisible 
companion, ... as any other occultation target also may 
have !


<p>Below, through the example provide by the delta Oph event, I will explain why 
the risk of bad prediction is significantly larger in case of 
bright "naked-eye" occultation than with our mag. 10 - 13 "normal 
events".


<p>A large majority (90 % ?) of occultation targets are giant stars,
of absolute magnitude (i.e. the magnitude they would exhibit at 
the standard distance 10 parsecs) between -2 and +2.

<p>So delta Oph is a M1 red giant 68 times larger than the Sun 
(surface radius = 0.6 AU), photospheric temperature 3700 deg. 
Kelvin, distance 52.5 parsecs (derived from the Hipparcos 
parallax), and absolute magnitude -0.9 corresponding to 210 times 
the solar luminosity.

<p>This is a fast evolving star. Its current mass should be close 
to 1.2 solar mass (1.2 Ms), and likely is secularly decreasing 
because of massive stellar wind. 

<p>The angular scale at 52.5 parsecs is 1 arc second = 52.5 AU in
the sky plane, or sqr(2)*52.5 ~ 74 AU (effective mean value) if
we roughly consider the 3D environment around delta Oph.


<p>Two kinds of invisible companion could exist. <ul type=1>

<li>The original primary of the supposed couple may have reached 
the white dwarf final stage long time ago, so that the luminous 
star we know presently would be the former secondary, now 
evolving in his turn above the so called "Main Sequence". 
It this case the mass of this former primary could have exceeded 
1.5 or 2 Ms in a remote past, but we know that today it is less 
than 1.4 Ms, the Chandrasekhar upper limit of stability for any 
white dwarf. The apparent magnitude of this unknown hot star near the bright
delta Oph might be V ~ 17 (relative luminosity 10<sup>-6</sup>), with a 
large uncertainty.<br><br>

<li> A normal "main sequence" dwarf star may stay too close to the 
giant to be resolved with a large fraction of all the existing 
instruments. 
Four examples of possible companions (extracted from Allen's book <B><I>Astrophysical Quantities</I></B> (1999)) are:

<table columns=4 border=1>
<TR><TH NOWRAP>Spectral type</TH><TH>V magnitude</TH><TH>Mass (Ms)</TH><TH>Brightness ratio</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>F8</TD><TD>7.6</TD><TD>1.1</TD><TD>1/89</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>G2 (= Sun)</TD><TD>8.4</TD><TD>1.0</TD><TD>1/185</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>K2</TD><TD>10.0</TD><TD>0.8</TD><TD>1/809</TD></TR>
</table>
.... 
</ul>

In any case the mass of the supposed pair probably lies in 
the range 2 - 2.4 Ms. So I will take 2.2 Ms, namely 1.2 Ms for 
delta Oph itself, and 1.0 Ms for the invisible component.


<p>Actually I doubt that the case (1) above is realistic.
Indeed I think that any hot white dwarf significantly closer 
than 10 arc sec. (~ 750 AU) would capture the strong stellar 
wind of the giant and produce spectrally detectable symbiotic 
effects. These should have been detected years ago (presumably...) 

<p>The case (2) is more promising in our current perspective. 
An efficient way to spoil the proper motion of the bright 
component could be a 2000 years period or so, corresponding to 
a 200 AU semi-major axis for the couple, or a ~ 2 arc sec. orbit
projected on the sky. More exactly delta Oph should describe a 
0.9 arc sec. orbit, and the companion a synchronous 1.1 arc sec. 
orbit around their common centre of masses.
Then the true track of delta Oph on the sky would be a very 
elongated sinusoid-like curve of period 5 arc minutes (i.e. the 
2000 years long = 300 arc sec. total motion), and semi-amplitude 
about 0.9 arc sec. or 900 mas.

<p>delta Oph appeared in the FK4 in 1963 and is accurately measured
over about one century. Then the extrapolated linear motion 
derived from the "instantaneous" observation by Hipparcos and 
the FK4-5-6 fit along one full century (here 1 century = 0.05 
orbital period) could differ by 44 mas or so.

<p>Applied to the next ROMA occultation, 44 mas would represent 
63 km in the Bessel plane, or 69 km on the European ground.


<p>Considering all the huge approximations above, straight off 
finding such a right order of magnitude appears fascinating !


<p>[Nevertheless I note that the radial velocity of delta Oph,
about -19.5 km/s, did not change appreciably between 1963 and
2007, i.e. within a 0.4 century interval. But this hardly 
proves anything...] 



<p>In any case it seems clear to me that unknown dwarf companion(s) 
orbiting deep inside the glare of a "naked-eye" giant target is 
able (sometimes) to seriously deviate the occultation path out 
of expectations.

<p>It is also noteworthy that the FK6 and HIP2 proper motion vectors of 
delta Oph have polar angles in 198.4 and 197.4 deg. respectively, 
whilst formal uncertainties (1 sigma) in both catalogues are 
0.1 degree... 



<p>Now let us consider the same target star, but virtually moved 
farther from the Sun by a factor 20, i.e. 1 kiloparsec from us.<ul>

<li>Its magnitude would become about V= 10.0 instead of V= 2.7. 
<li>Its proper motion would be 7.5 mas/y instead of 150 mas/y. 
<li>The above sinusoid-like track on the sky would shrink to 1/20th
scale, i.e. to a 15 arc sec. period and a 45 mas semi-amplitude.
<li>The Hipparcos-FK6 virtual discrepancy after one century elapsed 
would be only 3 km on the ground... [except that the real FK6 
does not contain such faint stars, its limit being V= 7.5]. 
<li>To witness the same 45 mas absolute deviation as above (with 
the actual delta Oph), we would have to wait the quarter of the 
2000 years period, or 5 centuries.</ul>


<p>There is no real doubt that unknown dwarf companions are 
commonplace close to giant stars. As perhaps 90 % of all our targets are giants, I guess more than 50 % 
of all the occultations we observe contain very tiny -and generally 
undetected- effects from such companions.

<p>However we have seen see here above that "custom occultations" 
of giants stars 1 kiloparsec away are almost protected against 
any prediction uncertainty caused by hypothetic (though often existing) 
close dwarfs companions. In contrast observing occultations of "naked-eye" 
targets is more likely a game of chance.


<p>In brief, the physical root of the proper motion problem is that 
the red giant and their unseen companion(s) have similar masses. 



<p>Actually this topic is not very new for me. Raymond Dusser and I discussed it privately when David Dunham went to Spain 
for the Regulus occultation in 2005. Our feeling at that time was that such very bright occultations 
do not deserve the high priority that IOTA, and also the [planoccult] community, are generally assigning to them. Actually these bright events bring almost nothing more than many well-observed classical events. Indeed, the primary justification for any special publicity given to bright star occultations is the possibility of attracting new observers into observing asteroidal occultations.
<p>*****

<H2>Addendum : What Regulus could teach us about delta Oph</h2>

<p>Regulus differs from the above scheme, as it is not a 
red giant. It is a relatively massive (3.2 Ms) hot dwarf star, 
whose angular diameter is 1.4 mas. It is located at 24 parsecs 
from us, and its absolute magnitude is V= -0.55. So in spite of its smaller size, it rivals many giant stars - thanks to its 12000 deg.K temperature.

<p>I will add that Regulus has a reddish V= 8.1 dwarf companion at distance 175 arc sec. or 4200 AU (projected). Moreover this companion is a visual binary of current separation 2.5 arc sec. (or 60 AU, projected), and possible 2000 years period
.
<p>When a close invisible dwarf companion itself is an even closer 
binary star (why not ?), its total mass may exceed the mass of 
the central red giant. Then the slow quasi-sinusoidal perturbation 
of the bright component is enhanced accordingly.

<p>This is not all yet..., as Regulus A is also a spectroscopic binary of 40 days period, and moreover the very close companion appears to be a white dwarf !
The mutual distance probably is 0.36 AU or 15 mas. The 40 days 
related oscillation of Regulus A has a 3 mas semi-amplitude, and 
so was unable to significantly affect the prediction of the 2005 
occultation. However I am sure that we did not anticipate such a 
phenomenon at that time.

<B><p>In brief. The risk that unanticipated complexity could interfere 
increases with the target proximity to the Sun.</B>
