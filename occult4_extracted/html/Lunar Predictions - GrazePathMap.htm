<H1>Graze path map</H1>
<P>This is a simple map showing the graze path</P>
<p>When called, the East/West and North/South plot ranges are set in accordance with the graze path being plotted; if it is called via a right-click menu, the longitude range is limited to 5 degrees. In all cases, the graze path plotted is limited to the coordinate range displayed on the graze prediction.

<p>You can specify different plot regions by changing the East/West and North/South values. If you regularly prepare maps for certain regions, you can specify up to 8 regions in the User Settings form and these are available for selection by way of a drop-down box. Additionally, the User Settings includes an option to open the map form using the first user-set region (rather than the calculated region.)

<p>You can plot the location of sites contained in any of the site files by selecting the site file from the drop-down box. The site file must indicate that the site can be plotted. The size of the circle marking the site depends on the category set in the site file (of plot 'only on 
detailed maps', 'on medium maps' or 'on all maps'). You can additionally plot the site name using the adjacent drop-down box to select those sites where the name is to be plotted.

<p>On the map:<ul>
<li>lines of latitude and longitude are in brown;
<li>coastal outlines are plotted in green;
<li>country and state borders are shown as a dash line, in red;
<li>the graze path is plotted in white. If it is a graze of a planet, both inner and outer graze paths are shown - the inner path being drawn in purple;
<li>cities and towns are plotted as orange circles, with names adjacent.</ul>
