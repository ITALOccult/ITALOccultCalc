<H1>Object altitude</H1>
<P>From this form you can determine the altitude of an object or its time of rise and set.
</P>
<p>Specify the objects J2000 RA and declination. The routine will precess that position to the date specified.</p>
<p>Specify your location. The default values when the form is opened are the values for your site set in the user settings.</p>
<p>Specify the date and time. If altitude is being computed, you need to specify the hour and minute. If rise/set times are desired, only the year+month+day is required - the hours and minutes are ignored.

<p>Click Altitude - and the altitude of the object at the relevant time is displayed. The altitude is corrected for refraction.</p>
<p>Click Rise/Set times, and the Local times of Rise and set are displayed - with the conversion from UT to local time being based on the Time Zone specified on the form. If the object never rises, or never sets (is circumpolar), a message to the effect is given.</p>
