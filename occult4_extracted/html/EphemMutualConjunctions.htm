<H1><A NAME="idh_4overview"></A>Mutual conjunctions (appulses) of the planets</H1>
<!-- Insert Header in above line -->
<p>This option provides predictions of mutual conjunctions of the major planets. The search separation can be up to 200 arcmins. Each event can be displayed graphically by selecting the event. </p> 

<ul><p><B>Note:</B> The term <B>conjunction </B>is frequently used together with <I>in right ascension</I>, or <I>in longitude</I> - to indicate when two bodies have the same right ascension or ecliptic longitude. The time when two bodies are at closest approach (appulse) 
	usually differs from the time of conjunction in right ascension, or in 
	ecliptic longitude.</ul>

<p>A sample output, based on a search for 2020 using a separation criterion of less than 40 arcmins, 
is:

<p>The prediction gives;
<li>The date and Universal time of closest approach (in decimal hours).;
<li>The separation of the centers of the planets as seen from the geocenter at closest approach, in arc minutes 
or arcsecs;
<li>The separation of the limbs of the planets as seen from the edge of the 
Earth where the planets are closest. geocenter at closest approach, in arc minutes 
or arcsecs. A -'ve value indicates that one planet overlies part or all of the 
other;<li>The type of event. <li class="auto-style2">Total = one planet either wholly hides the other, or one 
is wholly within the other - as seen from somewhere on the Earth<li class="auto-style2">
Part = one planet partially hides the other - as seen from somewhere on the 
Earth<li class="auto-style2">Miss = no planet partially hides the other as seen 
from anywhere on the Earth.<li>&nbsp;The elongation of the planets from the Sun (and whether the elongation is East or West); and
<li>The planets involved, together with their magnitude..</p>


<p>The graphic of the event shows the two planets, as illustrated in the following event (which is the next planet/planet occultation to occur.)/p>

<p>The initial plot scale is set by the minimum separation given on the initial prediction. Change the scale for the plot as required using the option buttons at the left. The scale is the vertical height of the plot screen (in minutes of arc.) The plot is drawn with North to the top, East to the left. It shows:<ul>
<li>The identity of the planet closest to the Earth - as the first planet named in the title on the plot.
<li>In the center, the planet furthest from the Earth.
<li>The planet closer to the Earth, plotted relative to the other planet at 1-hour intervals over a period of 5 hours;
<li>If one of the planets is Jupiter - the location of the Galilean satellites, plotted at hourly intervals. The satellite at the start of the sequence is drawn larger than for the other positions. If Jupiter is not in the centre, the satellite positions are plotted with respect to the plotted position of Jupiter.
<li>If one of the planets is Saturn - the location of Titan, and the rings. If Saturn is in the centre, Titan is shown at hourly intervals. If Saturn is not in the centre, the position of Titan is plotted with respect to each plotted position of the Saturn. Titan is shown larger at the start of the sequence than for the other positions.
<li>If one of the planets is Mercury or Venus, its phase.
<li>A plot of the Earth, showing the hemisphere from which the planets are visible at the time of closest approach. [The brown circles indicate the sunlit portion of the Earth.]</ul>
The following plot is of a close conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn on 2020 Dec 21.The 
plot, which is 16 arcmins top to bottom,&nbsp; is centered on Saturn (the more distant planet) and shows the relative 
motions of Titan, Jupiter, and the Galilean moons.<li>

<p>In the case of events involving Mercury and Venus, either planet can be closer than the other planet. 
Otherwise an innermost planet always passes in ffront of an outer planet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Interestingly, the great majority of close conjunctions occur at small solar elongation.</p>

<p>Occultations (and very close approaches) of one planet by another during the 21st century (with the solar elongation) are:
<li>2022 Apr 27 (Venus/Neptune), 43w (minimum limb separation 7&quot;, Australia/New Zealand)
<li>2037 Sep 15 (Mercury/Saturn), 15w (minimum limb separation 1&quot;)
<li>2065 Nov 22 (Venus/Jupiter), 8w [Partial transit by Venus. <i>Ganymede will also be occulted</i>] <B>See above plot.</B>
<li>2067 Jul 15 (Mercury/Neptune), 19w (Partial occultation of Neptune - NW North America)
<li>2079 Aug 11 (Mercury/Mars), 11w
Total occultation<li>2088 Oct 27 (Mercury/Jupiter), 4w (Partial transit)
<li>2094 Apr 7 (Mercury/Jupiter), 1w (Total transit. Io will also be occulted)</p>

<p>Historically there has only ever been one recorded mutual 
occultation - an occultation of Mercury by Venus observed from Greenwich 
Observatory on 1737 May 28, by John Bevis. The original report (which is in 
'scholarly latin') was published in
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/104333">Philosophical Transactions, Vol 41 
(1739-1741) pp 630-632</a>. Bevis was an amateur astronomer who had access to 
Greenwich Observatory. While the planets were at a solar elongation of 21.7 
deg, the altitude at the time of the event was only 1.4 deg, and there were issues of 
scattered cloud. Computations 
in Occult using the JPL-DE431 ephemeris show that Mercury was never completely 
covered by Venus. The event is discussed by Roger Sinnott and Jean Meeus in
<strong>Sky and Telescope</strong>, September 1986, p220-222. </p>
<p>Another historical event of interest is the occultation of Neptune by Jupiter 
on 1613 Jan 3. Whilst that event was not observed, it turns out that drawings of the Jovian system 
made by Galileo on 28 December and 28 January showed a 'star' which was in fact Neptune. [See <A href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v287/n5780/abs/287311a0.html">Nature Vol 287 25 Sept 1980, page 311</A> for full details.] </p>
