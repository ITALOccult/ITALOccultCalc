<H1>MoonMap</H1>

<p>This is a crude map of the moon, intended merely to indicate the location of an occultation against major lunar features. The moon map is particularly useful for reappearance, as it assists in identifying where the star will reappear against recognisable lunar features.</p>

<p>The displayed map of the moon is plotted with full allowance for librations. The map is plotted with true north at the top - with the position angle of the lunar north pole being taken from the observation used to plot the map. The location of the lunar poles is indicated by short lines.

<p>When the map is called from a list of ordinary occultations, the particular occultation event will be displayed (with UT and star magnitude). Right-click on the map, and you will have the option to plot the next 10, or 20 events in the prediction list; or to plot all events on the prediction list that occur in the next 12 hours. However all such events are limited to being on the same UT day.</p>

<p>If the map is called from the multisite prediction, the star path for each site is shown. Optionally the lines can be tagged with the number of the site in the prediction table - with the menu item <I>with Map.... Show path tags</I>

<p>The map can be plotted either as a normal plot, or mirror-reversed - from the menu item with 'Map.... Mirror image'. This setting is retained. A mirror image map is 
appropriate when your telescope has an odd number of reflections in the optical path (e.g., a Schmidt-Cassegrain with a diagonal).</p>

<p>The map is drawn/redrawn in either Colour, or Black & White - from the menu item <I>With Map... B&W</I>.</p> 

<p>The names of the larger craters can be displayed under <I>With map... Show crater names</I>.</p>

<p>The map may be printed by selecting the menu item With map... Print. The map is always printed as Black & White. If the map is drawn for ordinary occultations (but not a multisite prediction), predictions for the plotted events are included below the map. [Extra lines are limited to double star details.]</p>

<p>The map may be saved from 'with map... Save'.
