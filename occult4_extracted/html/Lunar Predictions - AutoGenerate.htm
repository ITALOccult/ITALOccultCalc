<H1>Lunar Occultations - Auto generate</H1>

<P>This form provides functionality for regional coordinators to generate predictions </P>
<p>The success of the functionality provided by this form is very dependant upon the content of the Site files. When learning 
to use this functionality, you should try using different site files covering different extent of coverage to get a feel for the relationship of the site file coverage and the output generated.

<h2>Selecting sites</h2>
<p align=center><img src="LunarMulti%20SelectSites.png"><br>
<p>Here you select the sites to be used in the prediction. You select the site file from the drop-down box, and then mark the relevant sites in the list of sites contained in that file. Use the buttons at the bottom to select or clear all sites.

<p>Note the numbers under the site file. These give the longitude and latitude range of sites covered by the site file. The coverage of regional maps generated by this form is determined by these numbers.

<h2>Set catalogue</h2>
<p align=center><img src="LunarMulti%20SetCatalogues.png"><br>

<p>Here you specify the star catalogue and objects to be used in the predictions. Usually you would use a subset catalogue, and not include asteroids.

<h2>Options for grazes</h2>
<p align=center><img src="LunarMulti%20GrazeOptions.png"><br>

<p>Graze predictions have a range of potential outputs. Here you indicate which 
outputs are to be included in the predictions, the file format to be used for graphic file outputs, the plot size (and hence file size) of the graze profile, whether the profile 
is drawn as color (on black) or Black &amp; White, whether to include the number of events indicator, and the basis for including observed data on the profiles.
<p><B>NOTE</B> For greatest accuracy, select either HiRes or Points. Plotting of 
Observed data was valuable when the Watts charts were the only source of limb 
data, but is not useful when LOLA data is used.

<h2><br>Output options</h2>
<p align=center><img src="LunarMulti%20OutputOptions.png"><br>

<p>The output from the functionality on this form depends on whether ordinary occultations, or grazes, are being predicted<br>
<h3>Ordinary occultation</h3>
<p><li>files are written to directories under the <B>Occult/Autogenerated Lunar </B>directory;
<li>the directories have the names of the various sites;
<li>within each directory the file name for the prediction is based on the start and end dates (in yyyymmdd format).
<li>the natural output is a text file. You can elect to have the output as a ZIP file, and for the text file to be deleted after Zipping - using the check boxes 

<h3>Grazing Occultations</h3>
<p>The output of graze predictions involves many files. To assist in the management of the files, the program works on the following basis:<ul type=1>
<li>The individual files are written to directories under the <B>Occult/Autogenerated Grazes </B>directory,
having the name of the relevant site;
<li>At completion of the prediction, the files for each site are zipped into a single file. Those single files are written to the directory '_Predictions'. The files have a name based on the site names, and the period covered by the prediction.
<li>After zipping, all the individual files are deleted - leaving the directories for each site empty.</ul> 
 
<h2>Set dates</h2>
<p align=center><img src="LunarMulti%20SetDates.png"><br>
<p>Here set the date range for predictions.
<p>Be particularly careful for grazing occultation predictions. The regional map showing the paths of all grazes in the region will be overcrowded if the prediction period is long and/or the star catalogue used includes faint stars. New users should try different periods and star catalogues to assess the most appropriate period to use.

<h2>Compute the predictions</h2>
<p align=center><img src="LunarMulti%20Compute.png"><br>
<p>Click the relevant button to compute the grazes or ordinary occultation predictions.
<p>Graze predictions will take much longer to generate than ordinary occultations, the extra time being associated with generating the graphics files and plotting observed data on the profiles.
<p> The Compute Occultations button has three additional options available. These options are used to generate a short list of predictions for publication in astronomical year books - such as the BAA and the RASC. The options are:<ul>
<li><B>Use short output</B>. A very abbreviated output is generated. [Note - this must be checked if BAA/RASC predictions are to be generated.];
<li><B>Use CA rather than PA </B>to indicate the location of the event; and
<li><B>Limiting magnitude</B>. This sets a faint magnitude limit - irrespective of observability. The default setting is 6.0. Any changes are retained between sessions.
More details about this option are described in<A  href="Lunar%20Predictions%20-%20BAA%20RASC.htm" > <B>BAA / RASC predictions </B></a></ul>



<h1>Generate Fixed Region bright grazes</h1>

<p align=center><img src="LunarMulti%20FixedRegion.png"><br>

<p>This option generates occultation path maps and regional graze path maps, of stars brighter than mag 4.0 and the planets.

<p>The prediction period is set by specifying the year, and selecting a period option from the drop-down box. options are:
<li>the whole year;
<li>a 6-month period - either the first or last half of the year; or
<li>one of 4 three-month periods.

<p>The predictions are generated for the whole world and up to 6 regions. The coordinate bounds of the regions are set in User Settings, under the 'Lunar occultations - grazes' box. Preset regions correspond with Australia/New Zealand, North America, South America, Europe, and East Asia.

<p>Output is located in the directory <B>Occult/Autogenerated Grazes/World </B> Files output are:
<li>For the World region map, the stars are limited to those brighter than 2.0
<li>for all other regions, the maps show the graze paths of all stars brighter than mag 4.0, 
<li>for each event where the star is brighter than mag 3.0, a separate world map showing the occultation path;
<p>For each map there is an associated text file providing identification of the graze paths by reference number.

The file names are the Region (as set in the User Settings), year, and prediction interval..
