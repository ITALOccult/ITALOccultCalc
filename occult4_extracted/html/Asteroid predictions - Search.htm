<H1>Asteroid Search</H1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<P>An asteroidal occultation consists of a path across the Earth having a width 
equal to the diameter of the asteroid. That is, the width of the path is only a 
fraction of the Earth's diameter. Furthermore, some of the path may be in 
locations which are sunlit at the time of the occultation, and/or may be in 
locations which are relatively inaccessible.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Occult generates predictions in a two-stage 
process. </P>
<h4>Stage 1 is</h4>
<ul>
	<li>specify the asteroid or asteroids to be considered in the search;</li>
	<li>select the star catalogue to be used in the search;</li>
	<li>set the start and end of the period to be covered by the search; and</li>
	<li>generate a set of Besselian elements for all events where an edge of the 
	occultation path comes within a specified distance of the Earth's center 
	(default distance is 1.01 Earth radius - with allowance for the effects of 
	stellar diameter being incorporated where appropriate).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stage 2 is</h4>
<ul>
	<li>filter the list of events to those that are of potential 
	interest. Those filters include parameters like solar elongation, local 
	altitude, minimum duration, minimum magnitude drop, faintest star magnitude, 
	and distance relevant to the observer's location.</li>
	<li>save the list of events for future reference</li>
	<li>create a 'personal feed' for Occult Watcher</li>
	<li>sort the events according to a range of parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>At any stage, selected events can be displayed, with a wide range of related 
information being accessible.</p>
<p>The present topic deals with Stage 1. The <em>Help</em> topic for Stage 2 is

<h1>The Search<span class="auto-style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (stage 1)</span></h1>
<P>This is the form for generating the Besselian occultation elements required to generate predictions of asteroid occultations. Each part of the form is described below.</P>

<h2>Set dates</h2>
<img src="AsteroidSearch%20Dates.png"><br>
<p>In this section, set the search period to be covered. Specify dates in years, months and days 
- which are all treated as UT. Buttons facilitate the selection of various periods.  

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Year</strong> button sets a 12 month period commencing at the start of the current month 
	specified in the Start date;</li>
	<li>The <strong>Month</strong> button sets a period for the entire current month 
	specified in the Start date. </li>
	<li>The <strong>Now</strong> button sets a period of 10 days starting from 
	'today' (set on a UTC basis, not local time).</li>
	<li>The three <I><strong>year</strong> </I>buttons set a search period of January 1 to December 31 for the current year, the following year, or two years in the future.  

	</li>
	<li>Click the text '<strong>Add one day</strong>' (located under the Start 
	date and has a yellow background), and the end date is set to one day after 
	the start date. Importantly, when this option is clicked, the end date is 
	set to one day later, and the form for selecting an asteroid is opened. If a 
	single asteroid is selected, the search will be automatically conducted&nbsp; 
	[after having downloaded the orbital elements from Horizons if you are 
	connected to the internet.]</li>
</ul>

<h2><br>Set star catalogue</h2>
<img src="AsteroidSearch%20StarCat.png"><br>
<p>At this location you specify the star catalogue to be used for the search. Catalogues that have not been installed are disabled. The primary catalogues are:

	created from the Gaia EDR3 data. It includes all information relevant to 
	occultation predictions and reductions (and has a few more fields populated 
	than the DR2 Occult versions). Stars were included if the 
	Gaia G magnitude was brighter than 16.0. Stars 
	were matched to one of Hipparcos2, Tycho2, and UCAC4 for the purpose of 
	having a simple star identifier. Many thousands of Hipparcos stars were not 
	present in the Gaia catalogue - and these were added. No attempt was made to 
	add stars from Tycho2 that are not in the Gaia catalogue as the precision of 
	the Tycho2 catalogue did not warrant their inclusion.<strong><br>Gaia14_EDR3 </strong>

	*&nbsp; Gaia11_DR2</strong><br>
	<strong>Gaia14_DR2</strong> was created from the Gaia DR2 data. It includes all 
	information relevant to occultation predictions and reductions. Stars were 
	included if either the Gaia G magnitude or Red photometer magnitude was 
	brighter than 14.0. Stars were matched to one of Hipparcos2, Tycho2, and 
	UCAC4 for the purpose of having a simple star identifier. Many thousands of Hipparcos stars were not present in the Gaia catalogue - and these were 
	added. No attempt was made to add stars from Tycho2 that are not in the Gaia catalogue as the precision of 
	the Tycho2 catalogue did not warrant their inclusion.<br><strong>Gaia11_DR2</strong> 
	was created a a magnitude-limited subset of <strong>Gaia14_DR2</strong>.<br>
	
	<br><strong>Versions based on Gaia Data Release 1. <br> </strong>If 
	previously downloaded, these can continue to be used. <strong>&nbsp;<span class="auto-style1"><em>Gaia14 
	is no longer available for download.</em></span></strong><br><strong>* TychoGaia</strong> is a version of the Tycho2 catalogue previously used in Occult 
	but with Gaia DR1 positions. Importantly, stars not in Gaia DR1 are not 
	included - which means coverage of&nbsp; bright stars is poor. Consequently, 
	for a comprehensive search involving bright stars, continue to use the 
	original Tycho2 catalogue (where the positions of bright stars will have 
	come from Hipparcos).&nbsp; Tycho-Gaia is available as a separate 66MB download as <strong>Download #38.
	</strong>
	<br><strong>* Gaia14</strong> is a catalogue created for Occult based on 
	Gaia DR1 positions of all stars to mag 14.0, matched to the UCAC4 catalogue 
	to derive proper motions.

	<br><br>Both Tycho-Gaia and Gaia14 provide very accurate star positions together with proper motions, but are missing about 20% of stars.<p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Search Filters</h2>
<img src="AsteroidSearch%20Filters.png"><br>
<p>The search for occultations identifies events that may be visible in any part 
of the world, and with no regard to duration or magnitude change at occultation. 
As a result, the majority of events found in a basic search will be of no 
interest to a particular location and observer. 
<p>To ensure the results of a search are generally relevant to an observer, 
six 'filters' are provided at the Search stage. (Extra, and detailed, filters 
are provided on the <a href="#14/Help/html/Asteroid predictions - ListAndDisplay.htm" target="_blank">
List &amp; Display form </a>)<ul style=i>

<li><b>Mag drop less than an amount</b>. This excludes events with small magnitude drops. 
<br>This test is not applied to Planets, as the considerations are more complex (eg an occultation against the dark limb of a crescent Mercury or Venus).
<li><b>Diameter less than an amount</b>. Excludes asteroids and planetary moons on the basis of diameter. If the search is for a range of asteroids, you need to set the minimum asteroid diameter of 
asteroids to include in the search. If you clear the check box, you will get a 
warning message about the large number of events.
The number of asteroids against diameter is shown in the following plot. The 
vertical scale is log<sub>10</sub>, and ranges from 1,000 to 1,000,000.<br>&nbsp;<img src="AsteroidsVsDiameter.png" width="250">

<li><b>Stars fainter than an amount</b>. Excludes stars based on magnitude. 
Values between 6.0 and 21.0 can be set. When applying this filter, you should select an appropriate Gaia catalogue. For example, if the star magnitude was set to 12.5, a search using Gaia14 will give full coverage, but will be considerably faster as the number of stars to be skipped over is less. 

<li><b>Duration less than an amount</b>. Excludes events based on duration. Values between 0.01 and 4.0 secs can be set. Generally a value of 0.3 to 0.5 would be most appropriate. This filter should usually be checked - to avoid a large number of events with very short durations. When you uncheck this filter, you will be given a warning message. 
<br>For extensive searches involving small asteroids, the output may contain a large number of events having a duration too short for reasonable observing. 
While such events can be filtered at in the List and Display form, the performance can be seriously degraded as a result of the large number of events. If the search is for a range of asteroids, you should set the minimum asteroid diameter of asteroids to include in the search. 
<br>Clear the check box if you don't want the size limit to be applied. This is appropriate for predictions of a single small asteroid. If it is cleared for a search for many asteroids, you will be overwhelmed by the number of events for any asteroid that is small.

<li><b>Taxonomy</b>. A drop-down box that provides a list of taxonomic classes 
of asteroids. To limit the search to a specific taxonomic class, select the class from the list. The search can be limited to objects falling within any of the standard 
taxonomic classes (which are explained
<a href="Asteroid%20Taxonomy.htm">here</a>) by selecting the 
taxonomic class in the drop-down box. For the usual search, set this to display 
<span class="auto-style6"> <strong>All</strong></span>. All 
classes are unique except for (i) Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHA) which 
taxonomy that can 
also apply to Amor, Aten and Apollo classes, and (ii) Binary asteroids, which 
can apply to any.<br>To search for a set of asteroids within a class, first 
select the Taxonomy class. Then&nbsp; use the <span class="auto-style6"><strong>
Select asteroid... </strong></span>button to set the range of asteroids to be 
considered. Only asteroids within that range having the selected taxonomy will 
be considered.<li><b>Using xx cm Telescope with X variable exposure camera</b>. Set the aperture of your telescope, and 
set the check for whether you are using a camera which you can set the exposure (for example, a CMOS camera, or integrating video).<br>
This test works on the basis (assumption) that a 20cm telescope, using an exposure of 0.037 secs (half-way between PAL and NTSC video frame rates), can reliably record a star at magnitude 12.0 under reasonable conditions. Changes in the aperture appropriately changes the magnitude limit. If the exposure can be varied, the magnitude limit is set such that at at least 3 exposures can be taken during the maximum duration. If the predicted magnitude drop is less than 0.5 mags, a larger number of exposures must be possible during the maximum duration.


<li><strong>Passes within</strong>  This identifies events where the occultation 
path passes with a specified distance from the observer's location. The location 
can be keyed in. Or it can be selected from any of the Site files the user has 
in Occult. The distance calculation allows for the diameter of the asteroid. It 
excludes events where<ul style=i>
	<li>the distance to the edge of the path is greater than the specified 
	distance. [This includes planetary moons, but not Planets.]<li>the star is more than 5° below the horizon at the time of the 
	event<li>the sun is higher than 8° below the horizon, and the magnitude is 
	fainter than 8.<li>the sun is above the horizon, and the magnitude is 
	fainter than 5.</ul>
	However if the motion of the asteroid is particularly slow (taking more than 2 hours to cross the Earth), these filters are not applied.<br>

</ul>
 
<h2><br>Select asteroids (or comets) to search, or planets to search</h2>
<img src="AsteroidSearch%20SetAsteroid.png"> 

<P>The options that are available depend upon whether the object is an asteroid, 
or a planet (including moons of the major planets).<h3>Select asteroids to 
search (main file of asteroid elements)</h3>
<P>There are several options to select the asteroids to consider in a search. 
All are accessed by clicking <B>Select Asteroids, </B>which brings up the 
following form. This form is used both for the main file of asteroids, and the 
User file of asteroids.<P>

<img src="AsteroidSearch%20SelectAsteroid.png"><p>The options for 
selecting asteroids are set out on the form.</p>
<p>If a specified asteroid is not found in the file, you will be advised and 
asked to re-enter the asteroid identifier. You can leave the form by selecting 
<strong>Cancel</strong>.</p>
<p>The bottom button <strong>Select from a list of asteroids</strong>, will list all the 
asteroids in the main file (or the User file). From there you can select either 
a single asteroid, or a range of asteroids. However you cannot select a series of 
asteroids separated by other asteroids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>use Horizons elements</h3>
<p>You can conduct a search based on orbital elements downloaded from the JPL 
Horizons system. When the Internet is available, this option should be used when 
possible.&nbsp; This is particularly the case where the basic integration scheme 
in Occult is inadequate, which may be the case when:<ul>
	<li>orbital eccentricity greater than about 0.4;</li>
	<li>semimajor axis less than about 2</li>
	<li>geocentric distance is less than about 0.5 AU</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style5"><strong><em>The functionality is only available for searches:</em></strong><ul>
	<li>for a single asteroid; and</li>
	<li>limited to 12 months duration;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you set the <strong>Set automatically</strong> check box, the <strong>use 
Horizons Elements</strong> will be automatically set when the search meets the single 
asteroid, less than 12 months, requirements.<p>Clear this check box when you do 
not want to automatically download Horizons elements - for example, when using a 
USER file of elements. This option will be automatically set when the conditions 
for using this option are met .<p>&nbsp;<h3>use Horizons ephemeris (predictions will 
be slow)</h3>
<p>This option will result in the most accurate predictions. It is not limited 
to any date range, nor to the number of asteroids included in the search. The 
setting is also independent of the '<strong>use Horizons elements</strong>, or
<strong>use USER file of elements</strong> settings. However there is a major 
issue of execution time....<p>When set, Occult will download an ephemeris of the 
asteroid (4 positions at 1-hour intervals, but at longer intervals when the 
asteroid motion is very slow) for each event it finds, and use that ephemeris for the final 
prediction details. When conducting a search, this download will occur for <em>
<strong>each and every event </strong></em>that is added to the <strong>Search 
Results </strong>listing. This necessarily slows the prediction speed - perhaps 
by a factor of 10 or more. This may become a nuisance when a large number of predicted events are likely 
- such as a search 
covering a large number of days, or when the asteroid is crossing 
a region with many stars.<p>When this is set, you will see a download notice as each 
event found is added to the <strong>Search results</strong> list. On the 
subsequent plot of the event, the ephemeris source (bottom right of the Header 
block) will include the text <strong>Horizons Ephem</strong>. 
<p><strong>This option is the most preferred way of generating the most accurate 
predictions</strong>. It supersedes the option available in the <strong>List and 
Display </strong>form.<p class="auto-style5"><strong><em>This setting is not 
retained between sessions.</em></strong><p>&nbsp;<h3>Select asteroids to search - User file of elements</h3>
<p>There can be occasions where a user wants to generate predictions based on orbital elements they have generated, rather than those available in sources such as MPCORB, 
AstDyS2 and ASTORB. The option <A href="FileFormat%20UserStar_MinorPlanetSearch.htm">User file</a> allows predictions to be generated on the basis of elements contained in the user file, which is <A href="User%20asteroids%20Edit.htm"> edited</a> from the main asteroid predictions tab. 
Check the 'with USER file of elements' check box to use the User file. <em>The search will be conducted for all objects in the file.
</em>
<p>&nbsp;<h2>Binary asteroids - Miriade</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://vo.imcce.fr/webservices/miriade/">Miriade</a> system at IMCCE- Paris Observatory can provide an ephemeris for 
the positions of the components of a small number of binary asteroids relative 
to the system barycenter (which is otherwise the basis of predictions). When 
Occult conducts a search for an asteroid included in the Miriade system, occult 
will automatically access Miriade to obtain an ephemeris relevant to the event 
date, and generate separate predictions for the each component. For some 
asteroids the Miriade system includes multiple orbit solutions; by default 
Occult will generate predictions for each component against each orbit solution.<p>
<strong>The controls provided are as follows:</strong><ul>
	<li>A list of asteroids 
included in the Miriade system. <em>The Miriade system will only be accessed for asteroids 
included in this list.</em> Currently (Feb 2019) this list includes 11 
asteroids plus Pluto (134340). Over time more asteroids will be included in the 
Miriade system. Occult will automatically update the list every 10 days - and 
	the date of the last update of the list is displayed next to the box.. The
	<strong>Update list </strong>button will also do an update - so that if you 
become aware that a new asteroid has been added into Miriade and you want to 
generate predictions before the next automatic update of the list, you can 
manually update the list.</li>
	<li>A check box to exclude the querying of Miriade. Check this if your 
	internet connectivity is slow (such that the search speed is unacceptable 
	for these asteroids), or you do not want the output to include the multiple 
	entries for the varies components of a system.</li>
	<li>A check box to limit the output to the first orbital solution. The 
	Miriade system generally includes multiple orbit solutions for each system - 
	with each resulting in a different occultation path location. There can also 
	be differences in component diameters. By checking this box, the output will 
	be limited to a prediction that takes no account of the Miriade data, plus 
	predictions for each component using the first orbit solution (which&nbsp; 
	IMCCE has assessed to be 'the best' solution.)</li>
	<li>A button to display the basis of the orbit solutions available at 
	Miriade. <a href="Asteroid%20predictions%20-Miriade%20solutions.htm">
	Details</a></li>
	<li>A check box to save the last Miriade response. This is provided solely 
	for test purposes. The Miriade response is saved in the <strong>DownLoaded 
	Files</strong> subdirectory with the file name <strong>
	LastMiriadeResponse.xml&nbsp; </strong>Details about the content of the XML 
	file are available
	<a href="https://ssp.imcce.fr/webservices/miriade/api/ephemsys/">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Output for Miriade binary asteroids</strong><p>Occult will provide 
separate outputs for each component of a system, for each orbit solution - 
structured as follows:<ul>
	<li>the asteroid number is present for all components, with no modifications</li>
	<li>The object name is the usual asteroid name for the primary component, 
	and the satellite name for other components. The satellite name may be a 
	'proper name' if it has been so named; or it may be a discovery designation 
	(such as S2016-107-1 for the first satellite discovery in 2016 for the 
	asteroid 107)</li>
	<li>Where Miriade data has been used, the object name has added to it a 
	solution identifier made up of '#' and a number 1, 2, 3 etc. representing 
	the solution number. Note that&nbsp; an output that does not use the Miriade 
	ephemeris will always be present - it will have the asteroid's name but no # 
	tag.</li>

Each query to Horizons take a little time, which will extend the search time. This will only be of concern for searches covering long periods of time. It can also be a major issue for Mars, where many 10's of events per day can be generated.</td></tr>

<p>It will often be desirable to give the output file a more meaningful name, or add the output to an existing file. Click the <B>Set output file </B>button, and specify the file name - either by selecting an existing file, or keying a file name in association with the directory of your choice.

<p><B>Important</B>. If adding to an existing file, make sure it is a file of occultation elements. Otherwise the file may not be readable.

<p>This block at the bottom of the form indicates the availability of files needed for the numerical integration of the orbit. If a file is available, the 
relevant button is disabled.  You need to make sure that the period from the osculating date of the orbital elements to both the start and end of the search period is covered by these files. [For searches of current events, only the <B>1995 Oct 10 == 2023 Feb 25 </B>button is required.]

<P>If you  need to create one of these files, merely press the relevant button. The file will be generated in a few seconds, and the button disabled.

<span class="auto-style1"><strong>HOWEVER</strong></span> you will need to have 
downloaded the JPL_DE ephemeris file - using <strong>Download #34</strong>. If 
you have downloaded several JPL files, it is not critical that you use the 
latest DE version for the integration scheme. You merely need to ensure you are 
using a version later than DE420.&nbsp; 

<p>This functionality is also provided under the menu item 'numerical integration data...  '.

<p>If you attempt to conduct a search which requires one or more files to cover 
the interval that are not available, you will be prompted to create the file.

<TR><TD>Adjust asteroid (Planet) position</TD><TD>This allows the user to apply a correction 
	when computing a prediction. This ability is only enabled when the 
	prediction is for a single asteroid, or a single planet. In the past such 
	corrections were most relevant for Pluto (with a default correction being 
	set in the User Settings, in the box <B>Asteroid occultations - search and display) 
	-</B> where there were problems with its ephemeris. In recent times the need 
	for a correction is associated with consistent offsets of an asteroid from 
	its ephemeris, and for asteroidal satellites where an ephemeris is not 
	available from Miriade 
	<br> 
	<br>The correction is specified in mas (up to &#177 2000mas) - with the 
	correction being the angular separation in the sky plane. This is important for Right Ascension - as a 
	difference in the Right Ascension coordinate values will need to be multiplied by cos(&#948) 
	to give the offset in the sky plane in the RA direction.<br><br>Examples of possible offsets are:<br>* 
	to specify the location of an satellite relative to an asteroid. Insert the 
	sky plane offset of the satellite relative to the asteroid;<br>* to correct 
	the position of the asteroid. &nbsp;Insert the sky plane correction to the 
	asteroid's position; <br>* to correct the position of the star. &nbsp;Insert 
	the <em>negative</em> values of the sky plane correction to the star's 
	position; </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Increase miss distance by X earth radii</TD><TD>In a normal search, occultation elements are output if the minimum distance of the center of the occultation path from the center of the Earth is less than 1.01 earth radii 
	plus the asteroid's radius Occasionally there is a need to identify 'close misses', or appulses. This option increases the 
	allowable 'miss distance' for events to be fully calculated and output - 
	with a range of up to 999 Earth Radii. </TD></TR>
<TR><td>JWST </td><td>Check to generate predictions for the James West Space 
	Telescope.&nbsp; Presently (2020) this option is provided for testing 
	purposes only, and uses a crude approximation that the JWST is exactly at 
	the L2 point. Events are output if the distance from the JWST location is 
	less than 5% of the Earth's radius (i.e. 319km)</td></TR>
<TR><TD>Clear the previous results from memory</TD><TD><B><font color=red>IMPORTANT</font></b>. Occult 4.5 introduces an important change in how search results are output. In previous versions all search results were written to file - and that file was separately analysed to select events of interest. In Occult 4.5, the 
	primary output of search results is to memory, with the results being displayed for 
	selection by filtering before saving. By default, each time you conduct a search, the search results held in memory are removed. However  if this check box is cleared, the results of 2nd and subsequent searches 
	are added to the results of a first search. This way you can build up a set 
	of predictions for multiple objects &amp;/or multiple dates.<br><br>The 
	check state of this box is not retained between sessions, and defaults not 
	not checked.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Star Catalogue, Orbit Source</TD><TD>These text areas advise of the 
	currently selected star catalogue, and the source of the orbital elements 
	(for asteroids)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Search/Cancel button<p>Progress bar</TD><TD>When the search is commenced, the search button is replaced by a cancel button. The functionality 
	of cancel is slightly different between Asteroids and Planets. For Asteroids, the Cancel has effect at the conclusion of the search for the current asteroid, whereas for planets it has effect at the conclusion of the current search day.
<p>The displayed progress bar has a similar difference. For asteroids, it displays how many asteroids have been completed in the search, whereas for planets the progress bar is reset at the end of each object, and displays the current position in the range of dates being searched</TD></TR>

</table>
<p>At the end of this section there is a label that indicates the orbital 
elements being used, and their download date. If that date is more than a month 
or two old, consider whether you need to do a fresh download and
<A href="Maintenance%20Convert%20Astorb.htm"> conversion</a>.
<h2>Results summary</h2>
<img src="AsteroidSearch%20ResultList.png"><br>
<p>This last section of the form gives a summary list of events found as the search progresses. The list is renewed for each new object being searched, with the current object being indicated at the top left of the box.. A '#' symbol after the star's identifier indicates the star may be a double star.

At the end there is text that sets out the period covered by the search, and the 
range of objects considered.<h2><br>Conclusion of the search</h2>
When the search has concluded, you will be automatically taken to the <A href="Asteroid%20predictions%20-%20ListAndDisplay.htm"> List and Display</a> form, where you can filter the list of events, and view individual events.
