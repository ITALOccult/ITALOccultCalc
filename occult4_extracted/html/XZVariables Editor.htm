<P>To use this editor, it is assumed that you are familiar with the <A href="FileFormat%20XZVariables.htm" target=_blank>
content</a> of the <B>XZVariables.dat</B> file.

<p>The editing tools provided allow for replacing an entry with an edited entry, or adding an entry. If it is necessary to delete an entry, that will need to be done using a text editor.

<p>It is important that the stars be ordered by their XZ number so that they can be found using a binary search algorithm. Any new entries are inserted in accordance with their XZ number. If an XZ number of an entry is changed, the star will not be moved in the list and the file will need to be manually edited to move the entry to the correct location.

<p>It is important to save any changes before leaving the form. No warning is 
given for unsaved changes.
