<H1>Asteroid observations - time base offsets</H1>

<p>This is a list of suggested time shifts - <I>on the assumption that the occulting object is circular</I>. For non-circular objects, this correction is absolutely misleading. It also assumes that the correction is caused by an error in the time base, and not (for example) an error in only one of the D and R times. In general, the corrections indicated by this option <B>SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED</B>. If a correction is to be applied, it must be done manually by entering the relevant value in the Time Shift box for the relevant event on the form for recording the observations.

<p>The primary uses of this list are:
<li>to identify one or two observations which are clearly discordant with other observations;
<li>to estimate the magnitude of any error in a time base - so that further investigations can be made with the observer to identify a cause - and THEN make an appropriate correction.
