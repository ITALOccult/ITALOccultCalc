<h1>To Plot and 'Reduce' the observations</h1>
<p>The following area at the top-right of the form is used for fitting an ellipse to the 
observations.
<P align=center><img src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20Plot%20control.png"width="250">

<p>The top part of this area provides the following controls:<ul>
	<li>a button (top left) to click (multiple times as needed) to get a best 
	fit solution</li>
	<li>fields specifying the location of the center of the fitted ellipse, and the dimension and 
	orientation of the fitted ellipse</li>
	<li>check boxes to select which fields should be included in the solution</li>
	<li>check boxes to force the solution to be circular, and in addition limit 
	the diameter to that of the diameter assumed from IR&nbsp; satellite 
	observations</li>
	<li>a check box to include Miss events when conduction a solution</li>
	<li>a check box to force a circular solution. </li>
	<li>a check box to force the solution to use the assumed diameter of the 
	asteroid (that is, the diameter derived using satellite measurements of 
	asteroid brightness)</li>
	<li>a small button with a red bar - to check all these check boxes</li>
	<li>fields specifying the offset of the center of mass&nbsp; from the center 
	of the fitted ellipse</li>
	<li>[<strong>being phased out</strong>] <em>a check box to use when the chords are reliably fit to a shape model, 
	with the center of the fitted ellipse being centered on the center of the 
	shape model</em></li>
	<li>a set of buttons to select (for events involving binary stars or 
	asteroidal satellites) which chords are to be displayed</li>
	<li>a drop-down box to set the quality of the fit (which flashes in color if 
	set to 'no reliable position or size'</li>
	<li>a check box to flag an event for review</li>
	<li>a slider, plus a set of buttons, to change the plot scale (which changes the range of the plot coverage)</li>
	<li>a checkbox to increase the range over which the plot can be scrolled, by 
	a factor of 25%</li>
	<li>a slider for changing the opacity of the form, so that the plot of 
	an event can be placed over other displays; and</li>
	<li>if the option to 'Draw asteroid profile' has been selected, a slider 
	<strong>Limb fit</strong> to 
	control the aggressiveness of the drawing process.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are explained in more detail below.<p>&nbsp;The 
bottom part of the right-hand panel lists the observers for the events included on 
the plot, with their reference number. If the paths are plotted in color, the 
path color for each observer is also given.

<h2>General features of the plot</h2>
<p>The plot of observations show Disappearances in red; Reappearances in green; 
Misses are light blue. Video or photoelectric observations are marked with 
circles, visual observations are marked with a '+' , Miss events are marked with 
an 'x', and Prediction is marked with an asterisk. When the tip of the cursor is 
located on an observation, the record number, name of the observer, and time of 
the event, are displayed above the plot. [If the observation is for a 
'predicted' point, the distance from the centre of the ellipse is shown.] The 
scale of the plot can be adjusted by using the Plot Scale slider in the control 
area. The position of the observations in the plot screen can be adjusted using 
the scroll bars at the side of the plot area.

<p>You can measure the gradient of the limb of the asteroid, or between points, 
by left-clicking at one point, and moving the mouse to the other point while 
holding the left click down. When this is done at an observer's event location, 
the observer's name, star motion, limb slope and PA, and the motion normal to 
that limb, is displayed in the box next to the cursor. These values are used in 
the&nbsp; <A  href="Asteroid_StarDiameterAnalyser.htm">
Star diameter analyser </a>. <strong>NOTE</strong>. The line drawing the limb 
slope is mis-placed won screens with resolutions greater than 1920x1200<h2>Plot options</h2>
<p>Under the <B>Plot options</B> menu item are a range of options about how the 
plot is drawn. Those options are:<ul>
<li><B>Plot on BLACK background (screen only). </B>Sets the background on screen 
to either black or white. Background on the printer is always white.
<li><B>Plot on GREY background (screen only). </B>Sets the background on screen 
to a light grey.
<li><B>Show star paths in COLOUR).</B> Sets whether the star paths and some 
other features are drawn in colour or B&amp;W. When drawn in color, a palette of 30 
colours is used. If there are more than 30 chords, the colours re-cycle. The 
colours are allocated on the basis of their current order in the Observations 
editor. [The event number, and whether or not the event is plotted, do not 
affect the colour allocation.] When the paths are shown in colour, a different 
event legend is displayed - showing the colours against each observer. This 
legend is graphics based, and can be saved when the plot is saved - separate 
from a text-based legend.
<li><b>use THICK lines</b>. Draws the star paths and ellipse using a thick line. 
The thickness of the line is set in User Settings, in the Graphics group..
<li><b>use LARGE font for labels</b>. Draws the observer numbers using a larger 
font. The size of the font is set in User Settings, in the Graphics group.
<li><B>Apply Watermark.</B> For use when an image is being sent to 3rd parties, and
there is a need to ensure the source is clearly stated. The Watermark is 
the current version of Occult.
<br><hr>
<li><b>Add DAMIT &amp; ISAM shape images</b>. Includes a displayed DAMIT or ISAM 
shape profile in the reduction plot. <A  href="Asteroid%20Results%20-%20Add%20Shape%20images.htm"> 
Details</a> 
.

<li><b><i>Show Shape model controls on plot</i></b>. This displays a set of 
controls at the top left of the plot area, where you can select the shape model 
to be displayed, and change its size. There are two groups of buttons 1 to 6, 
for 
possible <B>DAMIT </B>and <B>ISAM</B> shape models. To hide the 
controls, click the '<font color=red>X</font>' button at top right of the 
control block.
<li><b>Show MEAN DIAMETER indicator</b>. Currently only available for 
DAMIT models - this draws a line at the bottom of the plot corresponding to the 
mean diameter of the shape model currently displayed. Two 'mean diameters' are 
shown. One is the diameter of a sphere having the same Volume as the shape 
model, while the other is the diameter of a sphere having the same Surface Area 
as the shape model. The larger diameter is associated with the sphere having the 
same Surface Area.
<br>The value of the two mean diameters, in KM, is displayed above (Volume) and 
below (Surface area) the line - but those values have meaning only when you have 
fitted the shape model to the observed chords!

<br>[A similar line can be drawn on the downloaded graphic by setting the menu 
item on the <strong>DAMIT and ISAM shape models</strong> form - <strong>with 
Model image... Draw mean Diameter on Image {DAMIT only}</strong>]
<li><strong>Add an image from the clipboard</strong>. You can add any image you like from the clipboard. However it is centered on the plot, and cannot be removed.</li>
<hr>
<li><B>Show SOLUTION values on plot.</B> Default is to show. This displays the 
solution for the axes of the asteroid (and their uncertainties) at the top of 
the plot. If the star is a double star, the solution for the separation and 
position angle (and their uncertainties) are also shown.
<br>
<li><b>Show plot SCALE&nbsp; - mas (↕)</b>. Draws a scale line (in mas) at the 
right of the plot.
<li><b>Show plot SCALE - km (↔)</b>. Draws a scale line (in km) at the bottom of 
the plot.
<li><b>Show SCALE GRID (km)</b>. This plots a rectangular grid on the plot. A sub-menu 
	allows you to:<ul>
  <li>allows you to set the orientation of the grid on the plot, with a 
  drop-down selection list appearing over the plot. Once you have set the 
  orientation, use the '<font color=red>X</font>' button on that list to close 
  that list.
<li>A list of grid scales to select from</ul>
	To show or hide the grid, click on the main menu item <I>Show SCALE GRID 
	(km)</I>, and not the submenu list.
<hr>
<li><b>Show best fit ELLIPSE</b>. Default is to show the ellipse. While the 
ellipse will usually be shown it can be hidden so that the outline as indicated 
by the observed star paths is more readily viewed.
<li><b>... show Fresnel diffraction peak</b>. Draws a dotted line around the 
fitted ellipse or circle, indicating the approximate location of the peak in 
the Fresnel diffraction light curve.
<li><b>... show Ellipse in OUTLINE</b>. If the ellipse is shown it can be either 
a solid line, or a series of dots.
<li><b>Draw asteroid profile</b>. This will draw a curve to the plotted data 
points (other than those with zero weighting). The profile is generated as a 
cardinal spline defined by the D and R event loactions. The 'tension' of the 
line can be changed using a slider bar that appears over the list of observers.
<br><B>Important: </B><I>for this function to work, the observers must be sorted 
by path distance.</I>

<li><b>Show AXES of ellipse</b>. Draws the major and minor axes. They are drawn 
as a dashed line if the ellipse is a solid line, or a dotted line if the ellipse 
is a dotted line.
<li><strong>Show ASTROMETRY location</strong></li>. WHen selected, this shows the loaction of the point which is used to derive the astrometric position. Usually this is centered on the fiited ellipse. If a shape model is fitted, it can be loacted on the center of the shape model. For a binary asteroid, it can be loacted at the enmter of mass. 
<li><b>Show event MARKERS.</b> Default is to show the events - red for D, green 
for R, purple for a Miss. Video or photoelectric observations are marked with 
circles, visual observations are marked with a '+', and Miss events are marked 
with an 'x'. These can be turned off - which may be useful if the events are 
drawn using some of the other options.)
<li><b>Show observer NUMBERS.</b>  This is the record number; it is also listed 
against the observer in the box at the right of the plot form and can be used to 
associate points on the plot with the observers. The number is shown in italics 
if a zero-weighting has been applied.
<li><B>Show PREDICTED centre path</B>. This selectively shows those points that 
have been entered on the basis of the predictions. Use it to show the difference 
between prediction and observation. When star paths are plotted, the path for 
this location is shown as a series of long dashes.
<li><b>ALIGN primary and secondary star events</b>. When a double star is 
involved, the events for the secondary star can be moved to align with the 
events from the primary star . Doing this can lead to a more complete outline of 
the asteroid. 
<br><br>
When the events are aligned, a representation of the separation and PA of the 
components is given in the centre of the asteroid - on the same scale as the 
asteroid plot.
<br><hr>
<li><b>Show ERROR bars.</b>  When the report includes a figure for the timing 
	uncertainty, and error bar corresponding to that uncertainty is drawn at 
	each event location. Where no uncertainty is given, the uncertainty is taken 
	to be +/- 0.5 secs for visual events, and +/- 0.1 secs for 
	video/photoelectric events. The error bars are drawn in red/green for D &amp; R 
	respectively.
<li><b>...&nbsp; Set for fitting to Shape Models</b>. The uncertainty in the <em>
Length</em> of a chord is the quadratic sum of the uncertainties for the two 
event times. When this is set, the uncertainties as plotted are reduced to match 
the uncertainties in the chord length. Use these error bars to derive the 
maximum/minimum diameters of the asteroid from the shape model (inner end gives 
the maximum diameter, outer end the minimum diameter). There is a corresponding 
button on the Shape Model control to set/clear this option. The setting is 
cleared whenever the asteroid is changed, or whenever the main Observations 
Editor form is selected. This is to ensure the reduced uncertainty bars are not 
displayed by default, but only when expressly required.<li><b>Show star paths - star OCCULTED</b>. This shows the path of the star when 
it was occulted. The outline of the asteroid surrounds these lines. Miss events 
are not shown.
<li><b>Show star paths - star VISIBLE.</b> This shows the path of the star while 
it was visible. The outline of the asteroid is within these lines. Miss events 
are shown with a continuous line having small breaks..
<br>Rarely an observer will record <font color=red>multiple events from the same 
location</font> - either as a grazing event, or the effect of satellites. To 
ensure the plot of the star being visible does not overlie events from the same 
location, ensure the events from the same location are sequential and ordered by 
increasing time. [NOTE: For the plot to work in all situations, the 'Align 
primary and secondary star events' must not be checked.] 
<li><strong>Show RING event paths</strong> - This shows the path of the star 
associated with occultations (or non-occultations) by a ring. These paths are 
shown as a series of short dashes, always in a direction away from the main 
body. The paths for non-detection ring observations are shown as a series of 
close dots.<li><B>Include TIME-SHIFT corrections</B>. If there is an uncertainty in the 
accuracy of the time base, the record may include a 'time shift'. This 
correction is usually applied when plotting the observations. But if this option 
is unchecked, the observations are plotted without applying the time shift 
correction.
<br><hr>
<li><b>Show star paths for NO DETECTION events</b>. A toggle of whether or not 
the paths for No Detection events are shown.
<li><b>Show only VIDEO/photoelectric</b>. These observations are generally of 
greater accuracy/reliability.
<li><b>Show ZERO-WEIGHTED observations.</b> Some events might be given a zero 
weighting to exclude them form the analysis. This option selectively includes 
zero-weighted observations in the plot.
<li><b>Show path - star not seen (e.g. CLOUD)</b> This shows events (treated as 
Miss events) for locations where the observer could not see the event because of 
cloud. If star paths are plotted, the paths for these events are shown as a 
dotted line (grey when plotted in colour). It is useful when gathering 
observations, as feedback to observers of what they might have seen. Clouded out 
events are not transferred to the file of historical observations.
<br><hr>
<li>A group of 3 options for managing the check settings of these options. You 
can retain the current set of checks as Default values. If you change the checks 
when analysing a particular event, you can return the checks to the values you 
have set as your default status. And you can reset the defaults to Occult's 
default setting&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<li><b>Show star diameter analyser</b> Opens the <A  href="Asteroid_StarDiameterAnalyser.htm">
Star diameter analyser </a>, allowing you to input observer details and limb 
slopes from the observation plot.
</ul></p>

<h2>Set 'Miss' Times</h2>
<p>On the assumption that <strong>no detection</strong> events correspond to 
Miss events, the button on the menu bar computes the correction to be applied to 
the <strong>no detection</strong> 
events to ensure that the time specified is the time of closest approach to the 
centre of the plotted ellipse. Select this option, and the correction to be 
applied to each event is displayed in a form. Click the <B>Correct times in 
Report </B>button in this form to automatically correct the times of those  
events. Note that because of the way the plot is generated, it may be necessary 
to repeat this several times to properly align the Miss events. See <A href="AsteroidEditor%20-%20ClosestMissTimes.htm">
here</a> for further notes.</p>


<h2>Fitting an ellipse</h2>
<p>The reduction of the observations involves fitting an ellipse to the 
observations. The location, size, and orientation of the ellipse are specified 
at the right of the form. For each of these parameters, there is:<ul>
<li>an up/down box displaying the current value of the parameter. Clicking the 
up/down buttons will change the value.
<li>a check box to specify whether or not that parameter is to be included in 
the least squares analysis; and
<li>an indicated change to the specified parameter, based on a 'least squares' 
analysis of the fit of the displayed ellipse to the data</ul>

To the right of the boxes for the Major and Minor axes there is a display of the 
ratio of the Major to Minor axes (a/b), and the magnitude variation if the major 
axis was reduced to the minor axis (dM).
<p>In addition, there is an option about whether 'Miss' events are to be 
included in the solution. If this option is not checked, Miss events will not be 
included in the solution at all. If this option is checked, Miss events are 
included in the solution in the following manner:<br><br>
<li>The miss path is compared against the location of the edge of the current 
ellipse. 
<li>If the miss path does not intersect the ellipse, the miss is not included in 
the solution.
<li>If the miss pass intersects the ellipse, the point along the path which is 
furthest inside the ellipse is used as a data point for the solution
<li>Miss events are given a weight of 5, unless a different weight is specified
<li>For computing the shape and location of the occultation shadow, the computed 
distance of the Miss observation inside the 'current' limb location is increased 
by 0.5km. This bias reflects the Miss nature of the event. (that is, the fact 
that the star was above the limb at all times.)</ul>


<p>To obtain the best-fit ellipse, the following procedure should be applied.<ul type=1>
<li>manually adjust the 5 parameters to visually make an approximate fit of the 
ellipse to the observations. Then, on the Editor form, save the data for the 
present observation. [The manual fit reduces the likelihood of the least squares 
fit not converging on the solution. The Save step will allow you to retrieve the 
manual fit in the event that the least squares fit is a divergent solution.]
<li>At the top-left of the adjustment area is a button with a graph symbol on 
it. Repeatedly clicking this button will make the adjustments to obtain the 
least squares best fit. Save the data when done, as the final fit.
<li>If the fit does not converge, or the distribution of observations is very 
poor, it may be desirable to manually adjust one or more of the parameters, 
using the displayed indicated changes as a guide.
<li>When any of the corrections to be applied (they are displayed next to the 
check boxes) are very large, it may be appropriate/necessary to uncheck that 
particular item. [For example, a suggested correction to the PA of the ellipse 
of several hundred degrees would suggest that the solution for this parameter is 
very poor, and applying the correction may result in a diverging solution.]</ul>

<p>For certain events, it is appropriate to assume that the object is circular. 
Clicking the 'Circular' check box will force the minor axis to be the same as 
the major axis, and will exclude the minor axis and the orientation parameters 
from the least-squares solution. Note that if the observations are distributed 
around only one half of the object, it may be better to leave Circular as 
unchecked, specify the orientation of the ellipse to be parallel to the star 
paths, and (initially) uncheck Orientation and Minor Axis from the least squares 
analysis.
<p>In circumstances where the observations are not extensive, there may be 
several possibilities for the ellipse, some of which may be very elliptic. Some 
ellipses can be eliminated on the basis of being inconsistent with known 
magnitude variations of the asteroid. The value dM displayed at the top-right of 
the form gives the magnitude variation that would occur if the major axis of the 
ellipse was reduced to the minor axis. For a valid fit, this figure should be 
less than the known magnitude variations. Two sources of magnitude variations 
are <A href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/LightcurveDat.html" target = _blank> 
Minor Planet Center</a> and <A href="http://obswww.unige.ch/~behrend/page1cou.html" target = _blank> 
Geneva Observatory</a> 

<h2>Double star solutions</h2>
<p>If the event involves a double star, a floating panel appears on the form for 
specifying the separation 
and PA of the secondary star. Also the option buttons on the main part of the 
form have meaning, in allowing you to specify whether all events are to be plotted, or just those involving the 
primary, or secondary, star. When plot both stars is selected, ellipses for both 
the primary and secondary star are displayed - unless the option to align the 
events has been selected. 

<p>The floating panel looks like:<br>
<img Align=Middle Src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20Doubles.png"width="250">

<p>There are several possible scenarios for solving double star details, with up 
to 4 solutions. those scenarios are:<ol>
	<li>there are several chords for both the primary star and secondary star - 
	such that there is no doubt about which side of the asteroid each component 
	passed. This scenario will result in a single solution for the separation 
	and PA.</li>
	<li>there are several chords for one component - such that there is no doubt 
	about which side of the asteroid it passed. However for the other component 
	there is only one chord (or perhaps a small number of closely-spaced chords) 
	such that there is ambiguity as to which side of the asteroid this component 
	passed. This scenario will have two distinct solutions</li>
	<li>There is only one observed chord for each component. Typically, an 
	observation by a single observer who records step events (but it can also 
	arise with two closely spaced observers). In this scenario the solution has 
	to be based on an assumed asteroid diameter, and treating the asteroid as 
	circular in profile - which significantly degrades the precision of the end 
	results. Importantly, in this situation there are FOUR separate solutions - 
	with one star going first on one side, and then the other side, of the 
	asteroid - and for both of those situations, the other star going on one 
	side, then the other side, of the asteroid.<br></li>
</ol>
<br>An additional variation to this situation is the effect of close 'Miss' observations - which may lead 
	to the conclusion that some solutions are 'incorrect' as otherwise that Miss 
	observer would have recorded an event. However care needs to be exercised in 
	the treatment of nearby Miss observations - to properly allow for the 
	possibility of the asteroid being irregular, and the possibility that the 
	Miss observer missed an actual event.
<p>In addition, radio buttons are provided to vary the plot scale between 
normal, extend range by a factor of 5 - so that a widely-separated companion (eg 2018 Nov 9 occultation 
by Aspasia) can be readily included in the plot</p>
<p>A detailed explanation of how to derive the the double solution(s) are set out 
<a href="Asteroid%20Results%20-%20solve%20doubles.htm">here</a> </p>
<h2>Binary asteroid solutions</h2>
<p>If the event involves a binary asteroid, a floating panel appears on the form:<br>
<img Align=Middle Src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20Binaries.png"width="250"></p>
<p>The details about how to set the satellite solution(s) are set out 
<a href="AsteroidEditor-Satellites.htm">here</a> </p>
<h3>Setting the center of Mass for a binary asteroid</h3>
<p>When an event involves a binary asteroid, the display of the Center of Mass 
indicator is handled differently.</p>
<p>The first step is to fit an ellipse to the main body, and set the location 
and size of the satellite, using the usual controls for doing this. When this is 
done, Occult will calculate the expected location of the center of mass on the 
basis of the size of the two fitted ellipses.</p>
<p>Initially, the center of mass indicator is located in the center of the 
fitted ellipse. You can move the center of mass indicator using the Mass X and 
Mass Y controls at the top right of the plot form.</p>
<p>The Center of Mass indicator has dotted lines from that indicator to each 
body. Ultimately those lines will align and be straight. Next to the indicator 
are two lines of text. The top line gives the offset from the center of mass 
location (in km, which is the unit of the displayed plot). The first number is 
the distance along the line; the 2nd number is the distance normal to the line. 
The second line gives the ratio of the current distance between the two bodies 
(first number), and the ratio when at the center of mass (2nd number. This 
number is fixed, and is always less than 0.500 which is 
fixed). To set the center of mass, move the indicator such that the values on the top line are 0.0, 0.0, 
and the first number on the bottom line is the same as the second number. If the masses of the two objects are 
known, the location ratio can be computed - in which case the position is 
located when the first value on the bottom line corresponds to the computed 
value, and the 2nd value on the top line is 0.0.</p>
<p>The following two images illustrate this functionality, using the 2021 May 19 
discovery of the satellite of (4337) Arecibo. In the first image the center of 
mass indicator (the blue circle) is not at the center of mass position The top 
line indicates the current location is too far towards the satellite (14km) and 
is 3.8 km away from the line joining the two bodies (the center of mass must be 
on that line).&nbsp; The second image shows the center of mass indicator at the 
center of mass. The right number in the bottom line bottom line indicates the 
location of the center of mass along the line to the satellite (which is 0.143 
in this example). The left number shows the current location. (The difference 
between 0.144 and 0.143 is a rounding issue in the underlying data).</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Fitting to shape models</h2>
<p>For many asteroids, shape models derived from their rotational light curves 
are available. The main sources are
<a href="http://astro.troja.mff.cuni.cz/projects/asteroids3D/web.php?page=project_main_page">
DAMIT</a> and <a href="http://isam.astro.amu.edu.pl/">ISAM</a>. for the majority 
of shape models there is an ambiguity in the solution for the polar axis of 
rotation - giving rise to more than one solution, one of which will inevitably 
be 'wrong'. Additionally, early shape models were always derived using convex 
surfaces; however in recent years shape models incorporating convex surfaces are 
becoming more common (although the fit to occultation data is not necessarily 
improved....). DAMIT shape models are preferred to ISAM shape models because (as 
at Oct 2018) the DAMIT data include information that allows the mean diameter of 
the asteroid to be determined by fitting the shape model to the observed chords, 
whereas the ISAM data does not.. On the other hand, the ISAM shape models are 
usually quicker to download, and have an option to draw the axis of rotation on 
the plot.</p>
<p>The DAMIT system has up to 4 shape models for any asteroid, whereas the ISAM 
system has up to 6 shape models. The majority of ISAM models are the same as 
DAMIT models - but not always. And sometimes the additional model in ISAM 
provides the best fit to occultation data.</p>
<p>Occult provides a tool for fitting multiple shape models to the chords of an 
occultation event, and retaining the details of those fits for further 
analysis/consideration. In particular, one hopes that by analyzing the fit of 
shape models to multiple occultations by a particular asteroid will lead to a 
definite determination of which shape model is correct, and the true diameter of 
the asteroid.</p>
<p>The details about how to fit the chords to shape models, with the fit data 
being retained,&nbsp; are set out <a href="Asteroid%20Results%20-%20fit%20shapes.htm">here</a> 
.</p>
<p>When a shape model is fitted to the observations, the center of the ellipse 
may not coincide with the center of the shape model. If the fit to the shape 
model is reasonably good/reliable, you can move the circle indicating the 
location of the center of mass, so that it is coincident with the center of the shape model. 
The result of this is that the astrometry reported from the occultation refers 
to the 
center of mass of the asteroid . To do this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fit an ellipse to the observed chords. If you cannot fit an ellipse 
	without fixing any of the ellipse parameters that is, the axes, and&nbsp; 
	its orientation), you cannot/should not attempt to specify the center of 
	mass. rather leave it centered on the fitted ellipse. </li>
	<li>Using the controls marked <strong>Mass X </strong>and <strong>Mass Y
	</strong>to move the marker so that it overlies the center of the shape 
	model [indicated by a small 
	black circle]</li>

<p>In this example [2013 Nov 9 (176) Iduna] the fitted ellipse is quite different to the shape model. As the observed chords largely match this shape model, it is approriate to set the Center of Mass indicator to the center of the shape model, rather than the center of the fitted ellipse.</p><img Align=Middle Src="Asteroid%20Observations%20-%20CofM_EllipseFit.png"width="300"><br>

<br><em>The check-box option <strong>Shape Model</strong>, was used to indicate 
the ellipse was centered on the center of the shape model - that is, at the 
center of mass. That option was a poor attempt to deal with center of mass 
locations, and cannot be set for any new 
events (or past events where it has not been set). It is only present for past events that have not yet been updated to 
use the Center of Mass settings. </em> <br>
<h2>Setting the Quality</h2>
<p>The form includes a drop-down box to indicate the quality of the fit to the 
observations. This is not an analytical assessment, but is used to control the 
reporting of the events. The options are:
<table columns=2 border=1>
	<TR>
		<TH NOWRAP>Setting</TH>
		<TH>Meaning</TH>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD nowrap>0 No reliable position or size</TD>
		<TD>No useful data can be reliably extracted 
	from the observations. Typically, inconsistent observations, or a single 
	observation with a low level of confidence in the event.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD nowrap>1 Astrometry only. No reliable size</TD>
		<TD>No independent 
	determination of the diameter of the asteroid can be made. Rather the 
	observations are best represented by the default diameter of the asteroid 
	derived from satellite IR observations, or from estimates based on the 
	asteroid's magnitude. Typically applied 
	to a single observation with a high level of confidence in the observation, 
	or several consistent observations that do not allow an ellipse to be 
	sensibly fitted (usually the observed chords are closely spaced..)<br>Astrometry is derived (and reported) from these observations. For this 
	purpose, the observed chords are fitted to the center of the asteroid 
	(rather than one or other side of the asteroid) so that the cross-path 
	uncertainty is identical in both directions. </TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>2 Limits on size, but no shape</TD>
		<TD>An ellipse can be fitted to the 
	observations, but the fit is not very reliable. Examples are:<ul>
			<li>large 
	scatter of the observations - such that the uncertainty in the ellipse 
	diameters is inherently uncertain;</li>
			<li>poor distribution of events 
		around the profile, such that the fit is poorly constrained - either 
		because of large scatter. For example, two chords on either side of the 
		asteroid spaced well away from the center constrain the diameter in the 
		cross-direction, but not on the along-path direction).</li>
		</UL>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>3 Reliable size. Can fit to shape models</TD>
		<TD>An ellipse can be reliably fitted to the observations, 
	with a good distribution of points around the ellipse. The observations can 
	be fitted to shape models (if they exist) to assess whether the shape model 
	is correct, and the volume-equivalent and/or surface-equivalent diameter of 
	the shape model (that is, the asteroid).</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>4 Resolution better than shape models</TD>
		<TD>As for #3. However the 
	observations sufficient to clearly show deviations of the asteroid's outline 
	from shape models (if they exist), and/or clearly show irregularities in the 
	asteroid's profile. </TD>

<p><B>NOTE</B> The allocation of this assessment is used for two purposes: the 
reporting of the diameters of asteroids, where the results are sorted into the 
quality values of Poor, Good, and Excellent; and the reporting of the relative 
position of the star and asteroid at the occultation - where Time Only events 
have an uncertainty based on the diameter of the asteroid, and the 
Poor/Good/Excellent events have an uncertainty based on the fit of the ellipse 
to the observations. The correct allocation of the quality will ultimately be 
done by the primary program coordinator(s) who has responsibility for reporting 
the results.

<h3><br>NOTES:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The least-squares solution works best when there are observations spread 
around the entire periphery of the asteroid. If this is not the case, there can 
be strong interdependencies between the various parameters. For example, if the 
observations are limited to one half of the asteroid, then there is a strong 
correlation between the dimension of the axis bisecting those observations, and 
the position of the ellipse along that axis.

	<li>Where strong correlations occur, one successful approach to obtaining the 
fit is to turn off the least squares solutions for the major and minor axes, and 
get the best fit on the remaining parameters. Then turn off the remaining 
parameters, and turn on the major/minor axes and get a best fir for these. 
Repeat this as often as necessary until the fit (as shown with all parameters 
on) is optimal.

	<li>Remember that the minimum number of points required to define an ellipse is 
5. Any fit based on a smaller number must involve some assumptions about one or 
more parameters. But while 5 or more points in principal can fully define an 
ellipse, the quality of that fit is very dependent upon the extent of 
observational errors, and the distribution of the observed points.

	<li>The location of the centre of the plot is defined by the average of the 
extreme displayed observation points in the N/S and E/W directions. As a result, 
adding or removing displayed events that define these extremes will result in a 
relative shift of the location of the ellipse to the observations. 

	<li>The least squares fit is done on the basis of the function for an ellipse x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup> 
+y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>=1 using changes of 0.01 km in the position and size 
of the ellipse, and 0.01 deg in the PA of the ellipse, to determine the changes. 
The changes are measured along the radius from the centre of the ellipse to the 
plot point. Unless a weight has been specified at the data entry stage, visual 
observations are accorded a weight of 1, and video/photoelectric observations 
weighted as 4.</ul>
<h3>Other notes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The centre of the plot is defined by the average of the extremes of all 
events. If an observation is significantly in error, it may push many/most of 
the other observations off the screen. To rectify:<ul>
		<li>If needed, set the plot scale to the extreme left - to make sure all events 
are plotted.
		<li>Check the menu item  <B>With Plot… Show observer no. </B>This will result in 
the record number appearing against each point. Identify the observation that is 
clearly in error, and either (a) correct the data, or (b) delete the event 
time(s).</ul>
	<li>An observation time will be treated as invalid (i.e. non-existent) if ANY of 
the fields for the time of that event are blank. Thus for 0 hrs or 0 mins, 
ensure a '0' is specified - do not merely leave the field blank.
	<li>The label is printed in italic text for observations where the weight is set 
to '0'.
	<li>The program makes no automatic correction for Personal Equation (PE). The 
event times should be corrected for PE before entering.
	<li>Observational errors of a few tenths of a second can seem quite large 
(relatively speaking) when the whole occultation event is only a few seconds. 
Remember this before deleting apparently discordant observations. This also 
affects the uncertainty of the ellipse fitted to the observations - no matter 
how good the fit.
	<li>Adjusting observed times by a multiple of seconds or minutes (so that they 
fit the remaining observations better) should only be done if there is a good 
reason associated with the method of timing used by the observer. Generally, 
this should not be done.
	<li>The program fits a simple ellipse to the observations. This is at best a 
simple approximation to the actual shape of an asteroid, which may be quite 
irregular.
	<li>When comparing the results from one occultation event against another, 
remember that a single observation does not indicate the 3-dimensional 
orientation of the asteroid. That is, the effects of foreshortening, and 
shadowing, cannot be detected. This means that the actual major axis of the 
asteroid will be at least as large as the major axis of the fitted ellipse. 
Similarly the smaller of the minor axes in a tri-axial spheroid approximating 
the asteroid will be no larger than the minor axis of the fitted ellipse.</ul>
<h2>Basis of the reduction</h2>
<p>Reduction of the observations is done in the following manner.</p>
<ul type=1>
	<li>The reductions are performed with reference to the fundamental plane defined 
by the apparent position of the star on the equinox of date. Co-ordinates on the 
plane are expressed in km.
	<li>The x,y co-ordinates of the observers on the fundamental plane are computed 
for each event
	<li>The motion of the asteroid on the fundamental plane is computed - using a 
quadratic representation
	<li>The positions of all observations are referred to a reference frame that is 
fixed with regard to the asteroid, by (i) for each event and observer, compute 
	the observer co-ordinates on the 
fundamental plane at the time of that event, and (ii) adjust the origin of that 
	fundamental plane in accordance with the motion of the asteroid, to a common 
	reference time.&nbsp; This is done using a cubic expression to represent the 
	motion of the asteroid,<li>The reference time is the mean time of all 
	positive events. However, if a satellite is involved in the event, the 
	reference time is defined as the mean of all the event times for the 
	satellite. This ensure that for systems where the satellite mass is small 
	compared to the main body, that the astrometric solutions are not adversely 
	affected by orbital motion of the satellite around the main body.<li>The average of the maxima co-ordinates for all events is aligned with the 
centre of the plot screen, and sets the origin for the analysis.
	<li>Positions are also computed for times 2 minutes before each D, and 2 minutes 
after each R. These are used to plot the star paths relative to the asteroid, 
and in calculations of minimum distance from the asteroid and time of closest 
approach.</ul>
<p>The ellipse is represented by the traditional equation: x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup> 
+y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup>=1

</p>
<p>For least-squares solutions, the residual is computed as the distance from 
the ellipse to the observed point, along the radius from the centre of the 
ellipse to the observation point. The normal equations are generated using 
variations of 0.01 km - and for double star details, 0.01” &amp; 0.01 deg.

with large numbers.</ul>
At the end there is one (or two) lines for the fitted ellipse. The format is: <B>NNNN (x,y), A, B, PA</B> where<ul>
		<li>NNNN is the ellipse identifier, 
		<li>(x,y) is the coords of the center(km), 
		<li>A and B are the major and minor axes (km), and 
		<li>PA is the orientation (-90 to +90 deg). 
	</ul>
Note that occasionally A is smaller than B -effectively the major/minor status 
is reversed - but the axes plus PA gives the correct ellipse.
