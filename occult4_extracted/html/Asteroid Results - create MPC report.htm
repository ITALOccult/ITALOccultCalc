<H1>Make / Submit Astrometry Report to the Minor Planet Center</H1>

<p>This option creates the dataset to be sent to the Minor Planet Center to report astrometric positions. 
The option creates a .psv file in the directory Occult 4\Asteroids\Results\MPC Files\. 
with a name structured as:<span class="auto-style6"><br>
MPC report_20241123_xyz.psv</span><br>where the numbers give the year/month/day 
the report was generated. and xyz indicates the report gives (x,y,z) 
coordinates.<p><span class="auto-style2"><strong>Important. </strong>
</span>Before creating the report, you must ensure that the observations submitted in the previous report have had the MPC number added to the observation <A href="Asteroid%20results%20-%20set%20MPC%20details.htm" >details</a> If this is not done, the previous events will not be marked as having been reported, and will be reported a second time (which the MPC will not appreciate.)


<h2>Format of the Report</h2>
<p>The report is created in accordance with the IAU standard for reporting 
astrometry - ADES. That standard can be accessed from this form, at the bottom.<h3>The 
report has 5 sections. The first three are: </h3>
<p># version=2022<br># observatory<br>
! mpcCode 275<br># submitter<br>! name <span class="auto-style3">A. Bnnnnn, full 
address</span><br># measurers<br>! name <span class="auto-style4">C. Dnnnnn</span><br>
! name <span class="auto-style4">C. Dnnnnn</span><br>
! name <span class="auto-style4">C. Dnnnnn</span><br># observers<br>! name<span class="auto-style5"> E. Fnnnnn</span><br>! name <span class="auto-style5">E. Fnnnnn</span><br>
! name <span class="auto-style5">E. Fnnnnn</span><p>The 
text in color are names ands an address to be included with each report. The 
names of the <span class="auto-style3">Submitter</span>, and 
<span class="auto-style7">Measurers</span>, are maintained in the Maintenance tab, 
User Settings, group <span class="auto-style6"><strong>15 Administrative 
Functions</strong>. </span> 
These settings are not distributed by Occult. Whoever has the responsibility to 
submit reports needs to maintain the list of these names in their copy of 
Occult.<h3>Observer names</h3>
<p>The list of observers is created from the observations being reported. The 
names are strictly Initial + Family name, and is sorted on the family name. 
Names of observatories or organizations are not allowed, and will usually be 
identified and excluded. Similarly for appellations such as Mr., Prof., PhD. 
Compound family names are allowed. While the program endeavors to extract names in the required format, the names should be checked for correctness and format [A. Name]. When the report includes names inconsistent with this requirement, names, a list of such will be displayed on screen 
- together with the relevant event details. When this occurs, you will need to 
go to the event, identify the relevant observer, and rectify the observer's 
name.<br>

<p>This file also contains the lines for measurers. This line is taken from the setting at the end of the User Settings page (which is blank in the distributed version). The names set are the principal individual collecting observations in each of the regional collecting groups.

<p>Also required are the contact person, and acknowledgement email address. This is of the person submitting the report to the MPC. Again, the fields are set in the User Settings file. 

<h3>4th section: telescope details</h3>
<pre># telescope<br>! design reflector<br>! aperture 0.2<br>! detector CCD</pre>
These details are fixed. The fields must exist for the MPC processing. The 
values specified are are completely arbitrary.<h3>5th section - the astrometry</h3>
<p>The following is an example of the content of the report. The content of each 
field can be ascertained by reference to the ADES specification.</p>

<h2>Generating the report


</h2>
<h2>


<img src="Asteroid%20observations%20-%20MPC%20report.PNG" width="400">
</h2>
<p>For the routine submission of astrometry to the MPC, the left panel of the 
form should be set as illustrated. The only setting that should be considered 
for change is the Constraint '<span class="auto-style6"><strong>Limit to before 
the end of</strong></span>', which is used to exclude events that occurred 
between the month specified, and today's date. The name of the file that is 
created, and its location, are as given at the beginning of this page.</p>
<p class="auto-style8"><strong>Important.</strong> The choice&nbsp; between x,y,z, and RA/Dec, 
must always be set to <strong>x,y,z </strong>for any astrometry sent to the MPC. The RA/Dec 
option must not be used.</p>
<p>The option 'Generate test report for yyyy only', is a test option that 
generates the report using just the observations of the current year. Not to be 
used for actually creating a report for submission</p>
<p>The option &quot;Astrometry only, with extra data' generates a report with no 
observers listed, but with extra information about teach event. This is not for 
general use.</p>
<p>All reports generated are written to Occult 4\Asteroids\Results\MPC Files\. 
The file name will include extra elements to indicate the basis on which it was 
created. For example, if it relates to a specific asteroid, or observer name, 
that asteroid or name will be part of the file name. This is particularly useful 
when creating an astrometric report for a specific asteroid, for submitting to 
an orbit computer (such as the Horizons system). An example is</p>
<p class="auto-style6">MPC report_for_(65803) Didymos_20240720_xyz_skrut.psv</p>
<p>where the file name indicates that it relates only to the asteroid
<span class="auto-style6">(65803) Didymos</span>, the fact it is an
<span class="auto-style6">xyz</span> report, and it is limited to events 
containing the name of an observer that includes the letters
<span class="auto-style6">skrut</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Submitting the report to the MPC</h2>

<p>When you have created a report and want to send it, the steps (and relevant 
buttons on this form) are:</p>
<h3>i. Validate report</h3>
<p>The button <span class="auto-style6"><strong>Validate report</strong></span> 
will take you to&nbsp; <a href="https://minorplanetcenter.net/submit_psv_test">https://minorplanetcenter.net/submit_psv_test</a> 
, which provides a test to confirm the report meets the ADES requirements. </p>
<h3>ii. Submit the report</h3>
<p>If the the report passes the test, the button&nbsp; <span class="auto-style7">
<strong>Submit report </strong></span>will take you to&nbsp;
<a href="https://minorplanetcenter.net/submit_psv">https://minorplanetcenter.net/submit_psv</a> 
to submit the reoprt. Follow the instructions on the page.&nbsp; Upon submitting, there will be a delay of several minutes for some initial 
processing. You will then receive at the email address you specified a report 
from the address <a href="mailto:vmsops@minorplanetcenter.net">
vmsops@minorplanetcenter.net</a>. All being well, that email will report
<span class="auto-style4">....has been accepted for processing by the Minor 
Planet Center.</span> This report is very important. It contains a <strong>
Submission ID </strong>(which looks like<strong><span class="auto-style7"> 
2025-06-00T16:03:33.676_0000GtUU</span>),</strong> and a list of 
unique <strong>observation ID</strong>s (which look like
<span class="auto-style7"><strong>LodF2TAu0000GtUU010000006</strong></span>) which are added to the Asteroid Observations file - see 
next section. You should move the email/copy the content of the email to a 
location where it can be easily retrieved<br></p>
<p class="auto-style8"><strong>NOTE. There are certain characteristics of the 
report as it relates to occultation results, which will result in the submission 
being rejected unless the individual submitting the report has been authorized by the 
MPC to submit such reports. </strong>This rejection is not indicated by the test 
page - only when you submit.</p>
<h3>iii Check processing status</h3>
<p>Click <span class="auto-style7"><strong>Submission status</strong></span> to 
bring up <a href="https://data.minorplanetcenter.net/wamo/">https://data.minorplanetcenter.net/wamo/</a> 
. WAMO means <span class="auto-style6">Where are my Observations</span>. Paste 
the Submission ID of a batch into the box, and click Submit. Information on what 
the report means is given vi links on the page.</p>
<h3>iv Check observations are in the system</h3>
<p>You can view the astrometry for any object by clicking
<span class="auto-style7"><strong>MPC Explorer</strong></span> to bring up
<a href="https://data.minorplanetcenter.net/explorer/">https://data.minorplanetcenter.net/explorer/</a> 
From here, specify an object. Then you can view all its astrometry, with 
residuals for many. Occultation astrometry is under Observatory
<span class="auto-style8">275.</span>&nbsp; To find these, sort the
<span class="auto-style7">Observatory</span> column to ascending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Adding publication details to the observations file</h2>
<p><strong><span class="auto-style10">This is an extremely important step.</span><span class="auto-style9">
</span><span class="auto-style8">It is used to keep track of which 
observations have been submitted to the MPC, so that the astrometry from an 
event is not included in subsequent astrometric reports.</span></strong> Click the button in the
<span class="auto-style6">Update observations file</span> box. You will first be 
asked to select the relevant file you have submitted to the MPC. Then the 
following form will appear:</p>

<img src="Asteroid%20observations%20-%20MPC%20add%20to%20file.PNG">
<p>This gives two options. </p>
<ol>
	<li><span class="auto-style5">Add MPC Observations ID</span>. This records 
	the date the observations were submitted to, and accepted by, the MPC - 
	together with the unique Observation ID</li>
	<li><span class="auto-style5">Add Minor Planet Circular number for the 
	observations.</span> This adds the MPC number containing the summary of the 
	observations.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;For both these options, locate the relevant email containing the list 
of Observation IDs (referred to above). Copy the entire text of that email 
(making sure all the ID's are included. (The presence of other text does not 
matter.) then click <span class="auto-style5"><strong>Paste observation ID's
</strong></span>This will populate the box will all the observation ID's.</p>
<p>The first option should be done soon after you have received the acceptance 
report from the MPC. It adds the date of submission, and the unique observation 
ID, to each observation included in the pasted list. To do this, make sure that 
option is checked; specify the <span class="auto-style6">Date of submission</span>, 
and click <span class="auto-style6">Add Observation ID's</span>. A scroll bar at 
the top of the screen will indicate progress. When the list is fully processed, 
it will be re-displayed with either a tick or cross after each line, to indicate 
whether the date and observation ID have been added to the event.</p>
<p>The 2nd option require keeping a watch on the Minor Planet 
Circulars to find when &amp; where they are published. The relevant address to 
retrieve the circulars is:
<a href="https://minorplanetcenter.net/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/MPCArchive_TBL.html">https://minorplanetcenter.net/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/MPCArchive_TBL.html</a> , with 
the relevant links being to the MPC######-### in the 2nd column - like<span class="auto-style6">

<p>Enter the object identification, and press Enter. To view observations, click
<span class="auto-style6">observations</span>. Wait a little, and a large table 
will be displayed showing all astrometry or that object. If you want to look at 
what Occultation Astrometry has been reported, the easiest way is to click the 
column header <span class="auto-style6">Observatory</span>, and select
<span class="auto-style6">Sort Ascending</span>. Then scroll down to find
