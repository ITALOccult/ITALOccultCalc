<H1>Messages from a graze organiser</H1>
<P>This form allows a graze coordinator to communicate with some or all of the observers who participated in a grazing occultation observation. The functionality requires the email addresses of the observers to be entered in the occultation report (where the observer's name is specified.)

<p>The box at the left is the area where the full text of the body of the email is written. Lay the text out as you would expect in the email. Note that the email will be created with plain text of fixed size.
<p>The text is maintained within the current Occult session if the message is sent, or the <B>Cancel, but keep text</B> button is selected. This allows you to re-use the text for the next message (for example, if you want to send slightly different messages to different individuals), or to close the form to do something else, and then resume creating the email.
<br>[Note: the form does not allow you to change to other forms while composing the message - to prevent inadvertant changes to the data used in the email.]

<p>Select the people to send the message from the list of observers with Email addresses. Observer in the report that do not have an email address will not be included in the list. Check the box against the names that are to be selected. Buttons allow you to set and clear all boxes.

<p>Optionally you can attach the currently displayed report, the currently displayed reduction, or the currently displayed profile plot. Note that if you have not drawn the profile, it will not be attached. If you want to send the profile to an observer with their observations hightlighted:<ul><li>draw the profile;
<li>from the profile form, select <B>Observed graze and occultation data.... List current observers</B>
<li>double-click the relevant observer on the list of names that appears - and the observations of that observer will be drawn in yellow.</ul>
and then create the email, and attach the profile.

<p>A BCC copy of the email is sent to the organiser's email address - which is listed at the bottom left of the form.

<p>When you click <B>Send message</B>, you will get a message advising whether the email has been successfully sent.
