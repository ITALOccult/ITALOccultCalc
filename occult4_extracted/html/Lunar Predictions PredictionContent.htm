The information provided for each pairing is 
<li>the magnitude of each component, 
<li>the separation;
<li>the PA; and
<li>the expected time difference between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> components of the pairing.
<br>Pairings are separated by colons. A double asterisk (**)indicates the pairing is an occultation discovery that has not been confirmed. 
<p>Where an orbit is available for the pairing, the separation and PA are computed for the date of the occultation. Where there is no orbit, the separation and PA are estimated by linear extrapolation of the values in the double star catalogue.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Close and suspected Double stars</TD><TD>Two additional message lines may appear for double stars. If the star is a close double, with a separation less that 2.0" and greater than 0.01", an alert line will appear like:

Where there are observations which suggest that a star <i>might</i> be a double star, an alert line will appear like:
<pre>3177 has been reported as non-instantaneous (OCc1608). Observations are highly desired</pre>
The OCC number in brackets gives the identification of the star in the file XZDoubles Discoveries. This message is generated for all double stars where the double star identifier is one of 'OCc', '	   ', '---', 'S  ' and 'GC '.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Stars in Kepler2 </TD><TD>If the star is a target star in The Kepler2 mission, that fact is tagged, together with the EPIC identifier used in the Keppler2 mission.

<br> To indicate the time difference from the start and end of the occultation of the object's disk. In this example, it will take 66 secs for the moon to cover the disk of the object.<br><I>Note: the displayed value assumes a circular object. No correction for the oblateness of Jupiter or Saturn is included.</I></TD></TR>

</pre>The first part of the line is the same as for any other prediction line. The additional information provided is:
<li>Cusp angle at mid-graze
<li>the distance from the site to the closest point on the graze path (in km)
<li>the azimuth of the direction to the graze path
<li>a simple formula to give the latitude of a point on the graze path for a specified longitude. In this example, you get the following latitudes by inserting the longitude into the formula<ul>
<li>E. Longitude = +149.06 => latitude = -35.53
<li>E. Longitude = +150.06 => latitude = -34.92</ul>
For observers in US/Canada, remember that your longitude is -'ve. 
 </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Terminator distance</TD><TD>If a dark-limb occultation occurs less than 20" from the terminator, the distance to the terminator, and to a theoretical 3" high mountain beyond the terminator which could be sunlit, is given in a message like:<br>   Distance of 2864 to Terminator = 12.2"; to 3km sunlit peak = 1.9"
<br>The distance to the terminator is calculated on an assumption that the moon is perfectly smooth. The distance to a 3km sunlit peak indicates a 'worst-case' scenario of the effect of a high mountain (which could be on the near or far side of the moon).</TD></TR>
