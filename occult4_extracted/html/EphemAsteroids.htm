<H1>Asteroid Ephemeris</H1>

This form provides for the generation of an ephemeris of any asteroids contained in the file of asteroid elements used for asteroidal occultation predictions. The ephemeris is computed using an osculating orbit that is integrated to near the date of the ephemeris.

<p>Select the asteroid from the list at the left of the form. The list can be sorted by asteroid number, or by name, using the buttons at the bottom of the list.

<p>Set the date for the integration of the orbit using the fields above the list of asteroids. The default date is 'today's'  year and month. The date should be set to a date within the range of dates set for the ephemeris.

<p>The start and duration of the ephemeris are set by the boxes at the top center of the form. The ephemeris duration is limited to 300 days - to avoid major differences between the positions from the osculating orbit and a perturbed orbit.

<p>The elements used for the orbit can be selectively displayed by using the check box 'Show elements'.
