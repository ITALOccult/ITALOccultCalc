<H1>Asteroid observations - relative path distances</H1>

<p>This lists the distance of an observer chord from the occultation path. The distance provided is a topocentric distance in km. In deriving this distance, the following approximations are made:<ul type=a>
<li>the surface of the Earth is approximated as a cone that is tangential to the Earth's surface along the path;
<li>the earth is spherical (that is, no allowance for the Earth's oblateness has been included)</ul>
The calculation is based on the minimum separation of the star and asteroid at the time of geocentric conjunction.

<p>The distances of this display may differ from those of the predictions - particularly when the asteroid path does not cross the center of the Earth - as a result of these issues.

<p>The distances use the location of the center of the fitted ellipse as the reference point for computing distances. However if one of eth entries in eth OBS file is a prediction line, the path distances are referenced to that prediction line. To identify such a line, the program looks for the first line containing the characters '<B>predict</B>'. [If there are several such lines, the first line will be used.]

<p>The chords are listed in the order in which they appear in the observations editor. As a result, you can change the order by simply sorting the observations in the Editor using the <B>with Observations...</B> menu item to select the various sorts. The changed sort order will be given effect merely by bringing the form displaying the path distances into focus.
