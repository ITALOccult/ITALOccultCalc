NOTES
All Text fields [Ax] are left justified.
All integer fields [Ix] are right justified.
All floating point fields are aligned by the decimal point.
For floating point fields, the number of decimal places used is determined by the accuracy of
 the reported data. The remainder of the field is padded with spaces, not zeros.
