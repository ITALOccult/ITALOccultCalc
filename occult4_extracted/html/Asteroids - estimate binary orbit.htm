<H1>Binary asteroid - estimate orbit size or Period</H1>
<P>This for provides an estimate of either the Period of a binary asteroid, or 
the Orbit Radius, given the approximate sizes of the asteroid and its satellite, 
and the assumed density of the bodies.</P>
<P>The method involves solving the following equation for either a (the orbit 
radius), or P (the orbital period), using a value of the Mass of the system M</P>
<P class="auto-style3"><strong class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style1">a</span></strong><sup><strong><span class="auto-style1">3</span></strong></sup><strong><span class="auto-style1"> = G * P</span></strong><sup><strong><span class="auto-style1">2</span></strong></sup><strong><span class="auto-style1"> * M /(4 * &#960
</span></strong><sup><strong><span class="auto-style1">2</span></strong></sup><strong><span class="auto-style1">)
</span></strong> </P>
<P>where G = 6.67259 x 10<sup>-11</sup> , with the parameters specified in units 
of centimeters for length, kg for weight, seconds for time, and grams/cc for 
density.</P>
<P>The parameter M is the combined mass of the two bodies. For convenience, the 
Mass is determined by specifying the diameter of&nbsp; the two bodies, and 
specifying an estimated density of the material making up the bodies. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>Size of the bodies</h3>
<P>At the top of the form, in the first two fields, specify the diameters of the 
main body, and the satellite. (If the diameter of the satellite is less than 
about 20% of the main body, its Mass is too small to make a significant 
difference in the result)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>



<h3>Density of the system</h3>
<p>In the 3rd field, you can specify your estimate of the density of the system. 
The output area below includes the results for your estimate, and 8 other 
density values. Three of those have associated text setting out a description of 
the Asteroid Class to which the particular density value is appropriate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Solving for Period, or Orbit Radius</h3>
<p>The last two fields are used to set either :</p>
<ul>
	<li>the assumed Orbital Period of the system, in hours; or</li>
	<li>the assumed Orbit Radius of the system, in km</li>
</ul>
<p>Below those is a table that gives, for a range of Density values, the 
corresponding orbital radius, or orbital period. The color of the fields 
corresponds to the color of assumed parameter that has been set. The first value 
in the table corresponds to the user-set density of the system.</p>
