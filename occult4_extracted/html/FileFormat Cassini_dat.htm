<P>The files NCASSINI.DAT and SCASSINI.DAT provide limb data for the north and south Cassini regions respectively. The data has been derived from an analysis of grazes reported to ILOC.

<p>The data is held at 0.5 deg intervals in P, repeating at 1 deg intervals in D. The range (and order) of the data in each file is:

<p>-  NCASSINI.DAT    P from  -7.0 to  +7.0, repeated for D = -2 to -9. The zero-based record number in the file is obtained as  2*(P+7) + 29*(-D-2)
 
<p>-  SCASSINI.DAT    P from 170.0 to 190.0, repeated for D = -2 to -8. The zero-based record number in the file is obtained as  2*(P-170) + 41*(-D-2)


<p>The limb height is stored as a single byte, decoded as:

<p>height = 0.025 * (byte - 128)
