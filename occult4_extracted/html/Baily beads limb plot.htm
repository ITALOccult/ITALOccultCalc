<H1>Baily beads limb plot</H1>

This form is where you make the detailed identification of the limb point responsible for an event, and add the event to the list of events.

<p><B>Stay on top.</B>  Click this menu item to ensure this form stays 'on top'. Click <B>Normal </B>to return to the usual priorities for viewing forms.

<h2>Recording an event</h2>
<p>The steps to record an event are:<ul type=1>
<li>Set the time of the event in the main form
<li>Set the approximate axis angle of the event in the main form
<li>Click Plot to draw the limbs
<li>On the detailed limb plot, identify the point on the lunar limb responsible for the event. This might be on the basis of the Watts charts, or from the plot of past observations.
<li>Point the cursor to that location. Right click - and the event time, together with the axis angle and limb height at the location of the cursor, is added to the list of observations.</ul> 



<h2>Plot options</h2>
The options on this plot are available from the menu bar, as follows:

<h3>Axis Angle range</h3>
<p>Here set the angular extent of the plot of the lunar and solar limbs - between 4 and 180 deg. The plot is drawn with the smooth lunar limb being the horizontal axis.

<h3>Height</h3>
<p>Set the extent of the vertical scale - between 2 and 20 arcsecs.

<h3>Lunar profile options</h3>
 The 
lunar limb is generated using LOLA data points. This plots the altimeter data points from the LRO LOLA, leaving it up to the user's eye to identify the location of the limb.
</p>

<h3>Observed graze and occultation data</h3>
<p>Here you can plot past observations of grazes and lunar occultations. The options available are:
<table columns=2 border=1>
<TR><TH NOWRAP>Menu item</TH><TH>Effect</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>Include ordinary occultations</TD><TD>If checked, the data from ordinary occultations are included. If not checked, only grazing occultations are included.<br><li>if ordinary occultations are included, the plot takes longer;<li>the effects of Personal 
	Equation on the uncertainty of the 
	limb height are greater with ordinary occultations<li>however ordinary occultations are often the only source of information for the relevant libration.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>None</TD><TD>No observed data is plotted</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>P, D[+/- X.Xdeg]</TD><TD>This plots observations according to their value in the P,D reference frame - with the indicated range in the D value.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>AA, L[+/- Xdeg], B[+/- Y.Ydeg]</TD><TD>This plots observations according to their value in the WA, L, B reference frame - with the indicated ranges in the L and B values.</TD></TR>
</table>

<h3>List limb heights</h3>
<P>For those that want to assess the numeric value of the limb heights from the Watts charts, place the cursor in the area of interest, and left-click. A form will appear listing the limb heights at 0.1 
degree intervals for 1.1 degrees on either side of the location.
