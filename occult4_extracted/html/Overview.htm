<P>Occult is a program dedicated to the prediction and analysis of occultations of astronomical objects, including lunar occultations, occultations by asteroids and planets, eclipses of the sun and moon, and mutual eclipses and occultations of satellites of planets.</P>



<P>The program has 8 principal components, accessed from the opening form:</P>

<UL>
	<LI><B>Asteroid predictions</B>  Access the routines for generating occultation elements, and then generating predictions of occultations using a wide range of selection criteria, and a wide range of output options..</LI>
<BR>
<BR>

	<LI><B>Asteroid observations</B> Record observations of occultations by asteroids, to analyse observations to derive the size and shape of asteroids, and to access the file of all historical observations. This section also includes options to display summary results, and administrator functions for reporting and archiving results. <BR>
<BR>
</LI>

	<LI><B>Eclipses and transits</B> Predict solar and lunar eclipses, and transits of Mercury and Venus. Predictions are valid over the period from the year -9999 to several 
	millennia in the future.<BR> Analyse observations of 
	Baily's Beads, and generate animations of an eclipse and the Baily's Bead phenomena.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>

	<LI><B>Ephemerides</B> Generate general ephemerides of solar system objects - including all planets, and all satellites brighter than mag 20. Also generate star charts.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>

	<LI><B>Lunar predictions</B> Generate lunar occultation predictions. Predictions can be generated for selected sites, for selected objects, or for multiple sites and objects. Predictions also include grazing occultation predictions.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>

	<LI><B>Lunar observations</B> Record and analyse lunar occultation observations, including grazing occultations. Optional data files allow for the investigation of the historical file of occultation observations going back to 1623.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>


	<LI><B>Satellite phenomena</B> Generate predictions of eclipses/occultations/transits of the main satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune with the planet. Generate predictions of mutual eclipses and occultations of the main satellites of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. <BR>
<BR>
</LI>

	<LI><B>Maintenance</B> Area for maintaining various files and user settings.<BR>
<BR>
</LI>
</UL>


This version of OCCULT is a complete rewrite in the language C# using the Net V2 framework, 
subsequently updated to run on Net 4.5. This program will function on any platform that supports the Net V4.5 
framework - and not just the 'Windows' environment. [For example, a Linux 
version of Net V2 is well under development.]
