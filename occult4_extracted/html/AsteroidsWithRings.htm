<H1>Asteroid Rings</H1>
<!-- Insert Header in above line -->
<P>As at 2014, 1 asteroid (Chariklo) is known to have a ring system. 

<h2>Edit file of asteroid rings</h2>
The file of asteroid ring systems can be edited from the Maintenance tab. The data to be entered for each asteroid ring system is <ul>
<li>The number of the asteroid (un-numbered asteroids are not catered for)
<li>the Right Ascension and Declination of the pole of the ring orbit (J2000, in degrees)
<li>for up to 5 rings, the radius of the ring, in km.</ul>

<p>The file also contains a field giving the number of rings in the system. This is calculated on the basis of the non-zero ring radii.
