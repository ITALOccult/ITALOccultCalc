<H1 class="auto-style1">This topic is for a legacy function that will be 
removed.</H1>
<p class="auto-style1">The legacy functionality relied on the occultation 
elements being held on disk with a fixed-length record structure - with the data 
for any one event being read from disk. The fixed-length record structure 
prevented easy modifications to incorporate extra data elements - and as a 
result became a barrier to the development of improvements to Occult. The 
replacement approach maintains all the prediction data in memory, allowing for 
easier access and filtering; it uses variable length .csv files and .xml files 
for holding relevant data.</p>
<H1>Asteroid - Summary of events</H1>
<p>The summary display is a convenient way of accessing events that meet the selection 
criteria set by the user. The summary list enables you to go directly to events of interest and generate the full range of prediction options for those events. Additionally, the summary page provides tools to:<ul>
<li>plot 'all' the occultation paths against a regional map, and
<li>automatically generate prediction files for all events listed on the summary - for inclusion on web pages and the like.</ul>

<P>There are two forms of summary pages<ul type=1>
<li>a Global Summary of events, in which local circumstances are not a consideration - that is, the selection criteria of the observer's longitude/latitude and the minimum distance from the star are ignored, and
<li>a Local Summary of events, where local circumstances are considered.</ul>
<p>The Global Summary is particularly useful for events with high uncertainty in path location (e.g. TNO predictions) or for occultations by planets - where the path location is large. The summary listing for the two summaries is shown below - using a combination of asteroid an planet predictions. Comparing the Global and 
Local Summaries - the left-half is identical, but the right half provides different information.

<TR><TD>Dist </TD><TD>This column gives either the distance to the path in km, or the minimum separation in arc secs - depending on whether the selection

<h2>Control functions</h2>
<h3>Display event</h3>
<li>You can display any event by double-clicking on the line. If the menu item <B>with Predictions... Auto-display of plot </B>is checked, merely 
highlighting the line will result in it being displayed.
<li>When the event is displayed, you can access all the  prediction options available from the right-click menu on the plot.
<h3>Sort</h3>
<p>The list of events can be sorted by any of Date, Diameter (km), Diameter (apparent), duration, Star magnitude, magnitude drop, elongation, distance, probability, name, number or star number. the list as 
initially displayed is sorted by date.

<p>The option <B>Exclude events included in FUTURE.DAT </B> excludes from the listing any events included in the downloaded version of the Future.dat file that is on the computer. This is particularly for generating a feed for OccultWatcher - it prevents the feed including events that are already included in Future.dat. [Note - if applied when displaying the Future.dat file, not all events will disappear - due to some different star formats in Future.dat.]

<h3>Stars occulted more than once</h3>
<p>A list of stars that are occulted more than once can be obtained under the menu item <B>Sort   List stars occulted more than once</B>. This is most relevant when predictions for a whole year are generated.

<h3>Abbreviated output</h3>
<p>This option (under with Predictions...) truncates the summary line - excluding all data 
fields after the planet name (but the Rec # field is retained.)

<h2>Regional plot of occultation paths</h2>
<P align=center><img src="Multipath%20Plot.png">
<p>You can plot a regional map showing the paths of all occultations in the summary listing that occur in that region - by clicking the <B>with Predictions.., Plot paths on a map</B>. Click <A href="Asteroid%20predictions%20-%20Multipath%20plot.htm">here</a> for details. <B>Note </B>For this functionality you can set up to 8 pre-defined plotting regions in the User Settings.


<h2>Auto-generation of prediction files</h2>
<p>The summary list provides functionality to automatically generate prediction files for all events listed on the 
summary. This function is particularly designed for those creating web pages, including those creating feeds for <A href="OccultWatcherFeed.htm">OccultWatcher</a>.
<p><B>IMPORTANT  </B>To use this option, you must enable it from the <B>User Settings</B>, in the box <B>Asteroid occultations - Search and display</B>. You must check the box<B> Enable generation of output files</B>, and then check those files that you want to have generated. To include city locations in the Occult map, you need to specify the site file in the <B>User Settings</B>.

<p>You should check <B>Exclude events included in FUTURE.DAT</B> under <B>Sort</B>, to exclude events that are already included in Future.dat.

<p>The Autogenerate function works as follows<ul type=a>
<li>The output files are written to the directory <B>Occult\AutoGenerated Asteroids.
</B><li>The site file used to generate the Multisite prediction file is that specified at the top of the form;
<li>The site file used to plot cities on the Occult maps is that specified in the <B>User Settings</B>;
<li>An index of the events generated is written to the file FileIndex.txt. each entry is a text identifier of the event, followed by a unique identifier;
<li>A series of control files is written to the subdirectory MJD. The file has the name of the unique identifier, and contains the Modified Julian day number of the date the relevant occultation element file was created.<br>Before creating a set of output files for an event, the program checks to see if there is a corresponding file in the MJD directory. If the file exists, the program compares the creation date of the current occultation elements with the date stored in the check file - and only generates output if the elements creation date is later than that stored in the check file. [This means that, for example, you can generate a summary using Steve Preston's Future.dat file, and the 
Autogenerate function will only create files for new or revised occultation elements.]
<li>If you are using an updated Sites file to generate multisite predictions, you can check the <B>Site file has been updated </B>box. This will result in the output files for that event being regenerated.</ul>
<p>See <A href="OccultWatcherFeed.htm">here</a> for more information on creating occultation feed for OccultWatcher, and <A href="GoogleMapsHelp.htm">here</a> for more information on creating a web page with GoogleMaps.
