<H1>Comparing Gaia measured asteroid magnitudes with Horizon's magnitudes</H1>
<H1>Displaying a possible profile using photometric data</H1>
<!-- Insert Header in above line -->
<P>This form is intended to assist with the interpretation of possible satellite 
detections, particularly when there is no shape model, nor rotational light 
curve data.</P>
<P class="auto-style10"><span class="auto-style2"><strong>Great care must be taken when using the information 
provided on this form. There is a real question of whether the information 
provided is reliable for the purpose being suggested in this form. It is 
provided on the <em>possibility</em> it may prove useful in some circumstances</strong></P>
<P><strong>This form can only be accessed from the Asteroid 
Observations editor. The data required to generate the displayed data cannot be 
manually entered.</strong></span></P>
<P class="auto-style3"><strong>There are two components to this form:</strong></P>
<h2>1.&nbsp; Retrieve Gaia magnitude measurements for an asteroid, and interpret 
them</h2>
<P>The purpose of this capability is to investigate whether the Gaia photometry 
of asteroids provides any indication of the presence of absence of large 
variations in the asteroid's brightness, that might indicate whether the 
asteroid was highly elongate.</P>
<P>The process retrieves the Gaia magnitudes for the particular asteroid, and 
compares them to the asteroid magnitudes generated by Horizons for the Gaia date 
of observation. The data can then be copies in <strong>.csv</strong> format for 
pasting into a Spreadsheet such as Excel, where it can be plotted as a graphic, 
and visually assessed.</P>
<P class="auto-style4">The assessment may not be straight forward. To avoid 
various issues that may affect the brightness of the asteroid, you need to look 
for groups of measurements that are fairly close in time, and assess the 
greatest difference in that group. Why? because if the time difference is within 
10's of days (not 100's of days) the primary cause of light variation will be 
rotational variation, which is indicative of elongation of the asteroid.</P>
<h3>The process is :</h3>
<P>i. Open the form from the Asteroid Observations Editor, under
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>List...&nbsp; Asteroid light curve data...&nbsp; 
Assess Gaia mag data; Assess photometric data</strong></span></P>
<P>ii.<span class="auto-style5"><strong> Step 1</strong></span>.&nbsp; Retrieve 
the Gaia magnitudes. Click the button for Step 1. This will open a form in your 
browser that displays a page at VizieR to undertake searches. The instrictions 
on what to do are provided in the box below. They are:</P>
<P class="auto-style7">On the Vizier Form that appears in a separate browser 
window:<br>1. Find the option half-way down the form on the Left to set <strong>
Max records</strong>, and select 'al<strong>l</strong>'<br>2. In the large box 
immediately following:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. clear any and all text in the 
box<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. place the cursor in the box, and do a 'Paste' 
(that is, control + V) to set the search. [The text to be pasted has been 
automatically set.]<br>3. Under that box, click <span class="auto-style6">
<strong>Quickview</strong></span> to confirm you have created a valid query<br>
4. In the box '<strong>Query name</strong>' give an identifier for your search, 
and set the '<strong>Output format</strong>' to 'csv'<br>5. Click
<span class="auto-style6"><strong>Run</strong></span><br>6. When the &quot;phase' 
indicates your search is <span class="auto-style6"><strong>COMPLETED</strong></span>, 
click 'download' at the right of that line<br>7. The file will be saved in your 
computer's default download directory, with a file name 'result (xx).csv'</P>
<P>iii. <span class="auto-style5"><strong>Step 2 </strong></span>&nbsp;Read the 
magnitude data in the file you have just downloaded. Click the
<span class="auto-style5">Read downloaded file</span> button, then find the file 
that has just been downloaded. It will be in the directory where you computer 
saves downloads as a matter of default.</P>
<P>That file will usually have multiple measurements on a date. When reading the 
file, the program will use only one entry per dates within 0.1 days of each 
other.</P>
<P>When the file is being read, the program will query Horizons to obtain its 
value for the asteroid's magnitude at that date/time.</P>
<P>The results are displayed in the large box, as <strong>Date, Gaia G 
magnitude, Horizons magnitude, and the difference.</strong>&nbsp; The displayed 
data can be copied using the<strong> <span class="auto-style5">Copy list as text</span></strong> 
button below the box.</P>
<P><strong>iv</strong> <span class="auto-style5"><strong>Step 3</strong></span>&nbsp; 
Copy the data to use in a spreadsheet such as Excel.&nbsp; Click the button
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>Copy list in csv format, ready to Paste into 
Excel&nbsp; </strong></span></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<p><span class="auto-style4"><strong>Step 4</strong></span>. Open the 
spreadsheet. Paste the data that has just been copied. It should automatically 
display as 4 columns. Those columns are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>JD of the Gaia measurement</li>
	<li>Gaia magnitude</li>
	<li>Horizons magnitude</li>
	<li>Magnitude difference</li>
</ul>
<p>Highlight the first and fourth columns, and generate a 'scatter' plot. This 
should plot the mag difference against the JD. From this plot, you can assess 
whether there is any evidence of significant rotational variation in the light 
level. <span class="auto-style5"><strong>REMEMBER</strong></span>. You must 
focus on points that are relatively close together in time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Analyze certain photometric data</h2>
<p>This option uses the data provided in </p>
<p><strong><span class="auto-style8">&nbsp;Combined spin orientation and phase 
function of asteroids</span></strong><br>&nbsp; B. Carry1 , J. Peloton2 , R. Le 
Montagner2 , M. Mahlke3 , and J. Berthier4<br>&nbsp;<span class="auto-style4"> 
A&amp;A, 687, A38 (2024)</span><br>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202449789">&nbsp;https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202449789</a><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The 
data can be downloaded from VizieR, at
<a href="ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/0/catj/J/A+A/687/A38/catalog.dat.gz">ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/0/catj/J/A+A/687/A38/catalog.dat.gz</a>
. It is a 17 MB .gz file</p>
<p>Occult uses this data to compute 2-color magnitudes of asteroids covered by 
the data. [Two-color magnitudes for asteroids has previously been extremely 
limited.]</p>
<p>Included in the data set are values for the oblateness of an asteroid 
(assuming it is an oblate spheroid), and the RA/Dec of the axis or rotation of 
the asteroid. These values have been derived from a vast number of 'sparse' 
asteroid magnitudes extracted from large asteroid surveys. The sparse nature of 
the data leads creates uncertainties in their interpretation. Nevertheless, it 
provides data that is otherwise not available; it just requires significant care 
in its interpretation and assessing reliability.</p>
<p>A file containing the data is present in the Occult Resources file directory, 
as <span class="auto-style2">HGsHG1G2_Magnitudes.csv</span>. Importantly, when 
creating this file, the data relating to the asteroid oblateness and axis 
orientation is limited to those asteroids where the uncertainty in the Green 
magnitude was less than 0.3 mags - to exclude oblateness measurements that were 
inherently unreliable. Thus of the 122,369 asteroids having color magnitude 
data, oblateness data is only included for 52,975 asteroids.</p>
<p>When this form is called from the Asteroid Observations editor, the data from 
this file is retrieved. If oblateness data is present, the form will display the 
derived shape and orientation of the asteroid at the event date. If the data is 
not present, that part of the form will not show.</p>
<p>Great care must be taken regarding the reliability of the asteroid shape &amp; 
orientation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>This example relates to the occultation by (9203) Myrtus on 2025 Mar 22.</p>
<p>When opened, the left half contains no data, whereas the right half contains 
a plot of the asteroid.</p>
<p>To complete the left half, click the button at step 1.&nbsp; When the VizieR 
form appears, and you do a paste (ctrl V) into the required box, the followiing 
search text will be pasted:</p>
<p class="auto-style5">-- output format : csv<br>SELECT &quot;I/359/ssoobs&quot;.MPC, 
2455197.5 + &quot;I/359/ssoobs&quot;.EpochUTC, &quot;I/359/ssoobs&quot;.Gmag<br>FROM &quot;I/359/ssoobs&quot;<br>
WHERE &quot;I/359/ssoobs&quot;.MPC=9203</p>
<p>Once the search is completed, download the file.</p>
<p>Return to the form. Click the button at Step 2 - <span class="auto-style5">
Read downloaded file. </span>This will populate the main box with the magnitude 
measurements - with Horizons being queried for each entry. The form now looks 
like:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The large box contains the magnitude data. Click the Step 3 button to copy 
the list in .csv file format. Open Excel, and paste the data with CTRL-V. No select the 1st and 4th columns, and  click Insert, and select the Scatter plot. You will get:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="auto-style9">Interpretations</h2>
<p>1. The profile plot at the right of the form. Above the plot is the RA &amp; Dec 
of the asteroid. Then the RA/Dec of the axis of rotation of the asteroid, and 
its oblateness of the asteroid. Finally, the position angle of the axis of 
rotation (the minor axis of the ellipse), and the latitude of the Earth as seen 
from the asteroid. The plotted ellipse takes into account the effect of this 
latitude value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This ellipse happens to coincide with one of two possible 
solutions/orientations for the main body in that event. This give a basis to 
select one possible fit over the other - although it is not a strong basis. It 
also gives a basis to adjust the axes of the fitted ellipse to have a ratio of 
2.25:1</p>
<p>How reliable is this? Good question. Users should try this functionality with 
a range of other asteroids in the observations file to build a level of 
confidence in the reliability of this data</p>
<p>2. Magnitude data.</p>
<p>i. there are two clusters of points towards the right, around 2457600, and 
2457700. They are all at the same level. This indicates (but does not prove) 
that there is little rotational light variation at that time (the system might 
have been 'face on'.</p>
<p>ii. There is a wide vertical scatter of the points near 2457200. This 
suggests either an elongate asteroid, or the presence of a satellite than is 
undergoing occultations/transits. However the magnitude difference is large at 
almost 0.5 mags, which corresponds to a 40% drop in light. This would suggest an 
elongate asteroid. Is this a reasonable possibility??? Or, given the 
observations being spread over about 2 months, are there other issues involved?</p>
