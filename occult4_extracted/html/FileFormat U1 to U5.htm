<P>The files U1 to U5 contain Chebychev polynomials for the Uranian moons 1 to 5. The polynomials were derived by Paris Observatory on a fit to observations made from 1954 to 2003. The polynomials are valid for the period 2006 Jan 1 to 2011 Dec 30 21h 48m 36s. The source files in ASCII can be obtained <A href="ftp://ftp.imcce.fr/pub/ephem/satel/la06/" target = _blank>here</a>, as files NOE-coefcheb1.res  to NOE-coefcheb5.res  


<P>The parameters of the Chebychev series are:<ul>
<li>Start date 2006 Jan 1.0
<li>Block size 29.99875 days
<li>#coefficients - 300 for each of x, y and z coords</ul>

All data is stored as doubles. There are 902 data items for each block, as follows:<ul>
<li>Start date for block - as an offset from the start date of 2006 Jan 1.0
<li>Block size (days)
<li>300 cooeficients for X
<li>300 cooeficients for Y
<li>300 cooeficients for Z</ul>

with this repeating for all 73 blocks.
