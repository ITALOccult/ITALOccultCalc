	the work (Utilities.dll), the Help file (Occult.chm) and two configuration files.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../Asteroid</TD><TD>.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../Asteroid/Observations</TD><TD>A directory for collecting observation reports of asteroidal occultations</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../Asteroid/Results</TD><TD>A directory for holding finalised results</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >../Asteroid/Results/MPC Files</TD><TD>The files of results to submit to the Minor Planet Center are created here</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../Asteroid/Results/PDS Files</TD><TD>The files for archiving in the NASA Planetary Data System are created here</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../Asteroids</TD><TD>A directory for holding animated GIF files showing 
	asteroid rotation</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../AutoGenerated Asteroids</TD><TD>Location of the output files for autogenerated files generated from the 
	Asteroid List &amp; Display form</TD></TR>
<TR><TD nowrap>../AutoGenerated Asteroids/MJD</TD><TD>This holds files to control whether output files should be generated for a particular event - in particular, if the elements currently being used are more recent than those used for a previous output.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../AutoGenerated Grazes</TD><TD>Location for auto generated graze outputs. Empty directories bearing site names are created in this directory for holding intermediate files.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD nowrap>../AutoGenerated Grazes/_Predictions</TD><TD>Output location for auto-generated graze predictions - which are stored in zip files named after the site and 
	prediction period.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD nowrap>../AutoGenerated Grazes/GoogleMap files</TD><TD>.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../AutoGenerated Lunar</TD><TD>Location for auto generated lunar occultation outputs. Directories bearing site names are created in this directory, with the predictions being held in those files with names based on the prediction period.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>../Observations</TD><TD>Location for saving lunar occultation observations</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../Observations/Doubles</TD><TD>Location where lunar occultation double star reports (including any attached image file) are saved. Also the location for files used for the analysis of lunar occultation double star reports to derive double star separation and PA.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../Observations/LightCurves</TD><TD>Location for light curve report files, pending submission</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../Observations/LightCurves/Reported</TD><TD>Location for light curve report files after they have been reported. The files are automatically transferred here when they are reported.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../Observations/Results</TD><TD>Location for the files of reduced lunar occultations</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../Predictions</TD><TD>Default location for saving prediction files</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>../Predictions/AnimatedGIF</TD><TD>Location for saving the individual GIF files used to create an animated GIF</TD></TR>
