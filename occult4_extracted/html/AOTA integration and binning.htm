<H1>AOTA Integration, Binning, and Normalisation</H1>
AOTA provides the facility to bin observations to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Binning is also required when the camera is an integrating camera, so that each set of integrated frames is treated as a single measurement.

<ul><Li>This step occurs automatically whenever a CSV file is read.
<li>This step can be called at any stage during subsequent analysis - by going to the first tab and clicking the <b>Integration/Binning/Normalisation</b> button.
<li>For a signal from an integrating camera, this allows the first frame of an integration block to be specified, and for setting the number of frames in an integration block
<li>Can be used with a non-integrated signal, to bin the observed frames - again specifying start, plus number of frames to bin.</ul>	


<p>In principle, for a light curve with potentially multiple events, the binning levels can be set differently for each possible event. If the binning level is changed after measuring an event,  and subsequently that event is re-analysed from Tab 4, the final results for that event will be based on the current binning level.

<p>An illustrative form display is as follows:<p>
<img src ="AOTA_Binning.png" width="700">
<p>In this example the original light curve was from an integrating camera - and this is usually evident from the series of points at about the same level.
<p><ul><li>The plot displays the first section of the CSV file. The number of 
	points displayed can be varied by changing the form width, or by using <B>1. 
	Point length</B> item at the bottom left of the form. The Point Length 
	setting changes the length of the line for each frame displayed. The smaller 
	the value, the greater the number of points that are displayed.<li>The set of data points that are used for the first binned data point is indicated with a yellow rectangle. There are two ways of setting the location of the rectangle:<ul>
<li>Set the left side using the cursor and a Left mouse click; set the width using the cursor and a Right mouse click; or
<li>Use the <B>3. Binning/integration</B> box at the bottom of the form to set the start and width of the rectangle.</ul>
For no integration/no binning, use a rectangle aligned with a single frame. For a signal from an integrating camera, match the rectangle to a set of data points corresponding to a single block of identical output frames. This will set the frame ID to the first frame used in the integration block.
<li>The plot has faint vertical lines repeating at the integration interval - so that the correct positioning of the integration can be assessed along the light curve. {When the integration interval is correctly set, significant changes in the height of the signal should correspond to the location of the vertical lines - with the signal being largely constant in-between.}
</ul>

<h2>Expected magnitude drop</h2>
When analysing a light curve for the presence of an asteroidal occultation, it is useful to have the expected magnitude drop available early in the process - to assist with detection &/or assessment of whether a light drop is consistent with an occultation event. Set the expected magnitude drop in the blue box <B>2. Expected Mag drop</B>. The value set here will 
propagate through to other forms used in the analysis. A default Mag drop of 1.0 is set.
<p>If you are simply reporting a light curve, there is no need to set a magnitude drop - as it is not used in that process.


<h2>Integration/binning</h2>
<p>The form is used as follows:<ul type=1>
<li>display an appropriate number of data points to see the nature of the light curve, using the 'Display xxx data points'. Up to 4000 data points from the start of the file can be displayed.
<li>set the first frame to use in the binning by either positioning the mouse at the relevant point (by left-clicking), or adjusting the 'First frame' in the <B>3. Binning/integration</B> box at the bottom of the form. A yellow bar will be drawn at this location
<li>set the number of frames to be binned by either positioning the cursor at a relevant point and right-clicking, or set the 'Number of frames' under <B>3. Binning/integration</B> box at the bottom of the form This will result in a yellow box extending over the first group of frames to be binned. </ul>

<p>Specific points to note are:<ul type=a>
<li>If the light curve involves an integrating camera, ensure the yellow box coincides with a complete group of points corresponding to an integration interval
<li>the binning can be set to multiple integrations - just make sure that the box covers complete sets of integration intervals
<li>the width of the box (in frames) should correspond to the numerical value of the integration. For most cameras this will be one of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 or 256. For some cameras the integration interval may include 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96, 
<li>if you are unsure where the first full integration interval starts, set the yellow box to an integration interval that is well-defined. You can then re-position the box by merely clicking the left mouse button at the appropriate location - which will be a whole number of integration intervals earlier.</ul>

<p>For a non-integrating camera, the usual first frame to use is the first frame! If the SN is good, just 'bin' at the one-frame level (i.e. no binning!). But if you want to improve the SN, increase the number of frames that are binned until you get a light curve that clearly shows the event (if any).
<P>Click OK when done. Clicking cancel will return to the main analysis with no change in binning (and no need to reprocess).

<h2>Normalisation</h2>
Variable atmospheric transparency (such as light clouds) can have the effect of varying the light levels along the light curve. Such variations are usually present in all the stars in the field of view. If comparison stars are measured, the brightness of the occulted star can be adjusted in accordance with variations in brightness of the comparison star.

<p>Normalisation is achieved by selecting the comparison star to use (using the radio buttons along the bottom of the form), and specifying the number of data points to be used in a running average of the light level of the comparison star. The options available are 5, 9, 15 and 25, with 9 being the default value. 
The normalisation is performed on the binned values. For example, a running 
average of 5 is a running average of 5 sets of binned data points (not 5 
individual data points)<p>It is important to note that Normalization is not a process that should be routinely performed. If there are significant long-term variations in the brightness of the occulted star, and a comparison star shows similar long-term variations, then normalisation can correct the long term light variations in the occulted star. However there is always a risk of introducing other problems into the signal.

<p>The following 4 plots illustrate these issues. They are of a 'grazing' occultation, with two separate events being recorded. The observing conditions were not good - especially during the 2nd event, where there are a large number of 'invalid' measurements (marked with blue lines on the horizontal axis) caused by wind-induced vibrations.

<p>The first plot shows the light curve of the occulted star. Note that the bottom of the light curve in the two events is at a different level. Also note that between the two events the light level appears to drop by a small amount.<br>
<img src ="AOTA_Lumen0.png"><p>

This second plot has overlaid the light variations of a comparison star. That star appears to show a drop in brightness between the two events. Also during the 2nd event the plot shows numerous gaps - again, caused by invalid measurements. <br>
<img src ="AOTA_Lumen1.png"><p>

This third plot has been 'normalised' on the basis of the comparison star, using a 9-point running average. This shows that the light level of the comparison star is more uniform than previous - except in the region of the 2nd event. The problem here is that the use of a running average does not adequately allow for the presence of invalid measurements - leading to distortions in the light curve of both the comparison star, and the occulted star.<br>
<img src ="AOTA_Lumen2.png"><p>

This final plot shows the normalised light curve of the occulted star. Note the increased scatter in the regions of the invalid measurements. Ignoring those effects, it may be seen that the light level between the two events now appears to be constant. Also the brightness drop in the two events appears to be fairly similar.<br>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This option is currently only available for light curves measured with 
Tangra.</p>
<p>The usual method for measuring a light curve involves measuring the light 
level in a measurement aperture, and a corresponding light level in an 
equivalent background region - and subtract the background from the signal.&nbsp; 
This ensure the signal being measured is based on the star, and not the star and 
background light.</p>
<p>The problem with doing this is that noise in the background signal is ADDED 
to the noise in the aperture signal. That is, this subtraction increases the 
noise in the measured signal.</p>
<p>The <strong>5. Background </strong>option provide a choice between:<br>* 
subtracting the background on a frame-by-frame basis (the traditional approach); 
or<br>* subtracting the overall mean value of the background signal from each 
frame</p>
<p>This choice is currently only available for videos measured using Tangra. 
Also when Tangra is used, the option will default to <strong>Mean</strong>.</p>
<p>The potential benefit of this option is illustrated in the following two 
plots of the same light 
curve. The first used traditional point-by-point background subtraction. The 
second subtracted the mean value of the background noise from each point 
resulting in less noise overall - with 
the shallow event being much clearer, and therefore more reliably measurable.</p>
