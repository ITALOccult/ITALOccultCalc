<p>This file contains a series used to compute the position of the moon for periods not covered by the DE405 or DE413 ephemeris. It is an extraction of the series of Chapront (ELP-82) which was fitted to DE200. [The full series is available on the CD-Rom Astronomical Catalogues Vol. 3, from the Astronomical Data Centre.] All terms with coefficients >= 0.0005” have been included. The data within the file has been stored as follows:</p><ul>

<li>Main problem, large terms (Number of terms in Longitude, Latitude & Distance = 27, 14, 26)<ul>
    <li>D As Integer</li>
    <li>Lp As Integer</li>
    <li>l As Integer</li>
    <li>f As Integer</li>
    <li>Arg As Double</li></ul></li>

<li>Main problem, small terms (422, 386, 332)<ul>
    <li>D As Integer</li>
