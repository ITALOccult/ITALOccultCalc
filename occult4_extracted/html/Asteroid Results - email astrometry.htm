<H1>FTP upload of astrometry from asteroidal occultations</H1>

Periodically the astrometric results derived from asteroidal occultations is sent to the Minor Planet Center for publication. The report is in a standard format, prepared using the <A  href="Asteroid%20Results%20-%20create%20MPC%20report.htm">Make short MPC Report </a>option. The report is ftp uploaded to a secure server at the Minor Planet Center, with a separate email advising of the fact of the upload and of the file name.

<p>When opened, the box at the left lists all files that have not been sent to the MPC - on an assumption that when files have been sent and the results published, the files will be renamed with a leading "_".  All files in the relevant directory can be listed (if needed) using the <I>List all files </I>button.

<p>The message box includes as a default some standard text to include in the email. It can be modified as needed on a case-by-case basis.

<p>The BCC address is the email address that is specified in the User settings as the FTP anonymous password - that is, the users own email address.

<p>When the send button is clicked, the steps that occur are:<ul type=a>
<li>a message will show listing the data that will be included in the report, requesting confirmation;
<li>the files will be zipped (with the zipped file being saved in the Occult 4/Asteroid/Results/MPCFiles/ directory), followed by a request for confirmation to upload the zip file
<li>the zip file will be uploaded, and
<li>an email will be sent advising the MPC of the upload and the name of the file uploaded - with a bcc copy being sent to the sender.</ul>
